      "[Document(page_content=\"what's up welcome back we are building out a newsletter platform thanks so much for sticking around this far in this episode you'll learn how to add a an integration that allows our Express connected account types to view the express dashboard [Music] we will add a pretty simple little button here to the UI underneath our payouts where we have the list of different accounts we're going to add another button here to view the dashboard so let's open up our uh our counts index and instead of just having this edit button here we will also add a button for dashboard so we're just going to copy this whole TD and we'll paste it down here and the way that this works is we're going to hit the controller action inside of rails that will make an API call to strive to create what's called a login link and then we'll redirect to that URL so we are going to say we'll call the button open open dashboard or something or yeah open dashboard okay and it's going to need its form authenticity token so that we can correctly authenticate and then we also are going to need the stripe account ID that is for the the current account in the table and instead of account links we'll call this login links so we need to go create a new controller rails G controller login links open up our routes before we forget resources plugin links go to our login links controller and we will say before action we need to make sure that we have a user that is authenticated and then in the create action we're going to uh create a login link with the stripe API then redirect to the login link okay so for this we're going to call create login link the stripe API and it accepts in a stripe account ID so we're going to say params account ID actually okay so we want to make sure that this account ID really belongs to the currently logged in user so we want to say something like current user.accounts.where the stripe account ID is params account ID dot firsts that'll give us back the account and then we'll use that account dot stripe account ID what this will do is um ensure that the account ID they passed in actually belongs to them otherwise they might try to pass in someone else's account ID and try to view their dashboard so this gives us just a little bit of protection um allow other hosts and I think that might be it let's see if this let's see how this works so now we should be able to open the dashboard and we are redirected to the stripe Express authentication flow because we're in test mode we can just use all zeros as our code that was texted to us and look at that here we see all of our payments coming in for the newsletters that we're sending out so we've got a few different readers who are subscribed and are uh yeah we're accepting payments so this is pretty cool so we've got total earnings we can view our transactions and uh yeah we can even use the mobile app to to manage these payments so that is how we integrate with the express dashboard relatively straightforward and yeah this is a pretty simple way for users to just see which payments are coming in so that's pretty cool from your account settings here on the top right authors can also go update their payout details so if they wanted to they could change their bank account that they're receiving payments out to so that is pretty handy if authors decide that they want to receive payments somewhere else okay so let's go back to localhost 3000 and just take a look here so we're going to view our dashboard one more time we've got newsletters we've got issues that we are paying for we have newsletters that we're paying for we've got we can manage our billing we can manage our payouts and our payments so we are in a pretty good State one other thing that you might want to consider is using these embeddable uis from stripe these connect yeah connect embeddable UI components let you drop in the experience directly into your application so here is a view for payments we could add that for instance directly inside of our our payouts view right we could have we could use this the payouts um the payouts component so there's several different components here that you can use let's see right payouts so you could drop in this stripe connect payouts component and then use stripe.js to fetch and initialize strike connect and that would be a a way that you could visualize the payouts directly on this page okay so this is looking pretty good again thanks so much for watching and we'll see in the next one [Music]\", metadata={'source':

'publish_date': '2023-08-25 00:00:00', 'length': 332, 'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"hey what's up welcome back thank you so much for joining as we build out this newsletter platform we're at the point now where we are ready to onboard some stripe connect accounts [Music] now onboarding involves creating a connected account using the API then a account link which is another resource in the API that will have a URL that we'll use to redirect users through the connect hosted onboarding now if we head over to the documentation here you can look through this doc about how to use connect with Express accounts if you are curious about account types or charge types head over and look at the previous episodes where we dive in detail about which ones we're using for this series and also some trade-offs between your different options there now a couple of things to mention when we go through this onboarding flow the first thing we're going to do is create an Express Account Now this API call to create a new account you can pass in much more than just the type you might also include the country some capabilities which you know we know the business type in this case is going to be an individual if we have the profile on newsletter platform which can be that maybe it's like newsletterplatform.com author handle or something like that then we can include that URL the idea is that we want to pre-fill as much as possible so that our users don't need to go and enter in those steps as part of connect onboarding so that's one important piece of information the second is that this is how we're going to use how we'll create an account link and an account link has a URL property that we'll use to redirect them through the connect hosted onboarding there's a couple different events that we want to listen for the first one is the account.updated event this will tell us when the details submitted attribute of an account changes from false to true that means that the connected account has gone through all of the steps for onboarding now there's another thing that we'll want to keep track of and that is whether or not charges are enabled or transfers are enabled on the connected account that will tell us whether or not we can actually like send money to this connected account so we need to keep track of several different things in the database and let's start by creating a new account model so we're going to say rails G model account and this is going to reference back to a an author it's going to have a stripe account ID this is going to be a string ID that looks like this so this on accct underscore this is an account ID so we want to store that in our database because when working with connect we're going to pass that account ID in several different places to interact with the stripe API sort of like through this account or on behalf of this account okay so we want the account ID we also want to know if charges enabled or if transfers enabled and we also want to know if details are submitted and this should be a pretty good start so let's start with this model here let's open up this create accounts migration here and this string ID cannot be null and it also must be unique so we're going to add an index to accounts for the stripe account ID and we want that to be unique now these are also going to be default to false all three of these attributes start off as false so the way this will work is we're going to create a new controller we'll call it maybe the accounts controller and from that view if you have an account that's set up will display this these statuses to you if you don't have an account set up then we'll give you a button that will let you go through the connect onboarding so we'll generate this controller and it's going to be the accounts controller and we'll have index show and new let's open up this accounts controller here so I think yeah so for this index action here we'll probably say like accounts is current user.accounts and because we want to use the current user we need to make sure that we have an authenticated user for a single account we'll say account is current user.accounts dot find Ram's ID to create a new account this will be a form with just a button to create an account and create rather than just taking in some params and creating a model in the database what we want to do is first create or like first make an API call to stripe to create a connected account of type Express then create an account link with that accounts ID store the account ID in the database and redirect to the account links URL okay so let's see if GitHub copilot can help us out here so we're going to say count is stripe count dot create and we're going to pass a bunch of stuff in here so the type is going to be Express and ideally we also pass the country so we could take in potentially we could take in the country from this form um so yeah we could inside of our new form we could accept in the country as a parameter so we could say maybe params count country other things that we need to enable here yep we can pass in the email address of the current user and what I like to do is head over to the account API reference so that we can see all of the different things that we might be able to pass in or we might want to pass in so let's go to this accounts create endpoint in the API ref switch this to Ruby and at a minimum we also will always want to request the capabilities so we'll drop that in there are other capabilities you might want to request for other features and products of the stripe API like issuing but for now we're just going to request card payments and transfers transfers is the key capability that we need so that we can send money to this connected account now there is another param here so we can also let's set the business type to individual because we know this person is going to be an individual as an author we can also set some information about the company if we'd like we can set information about the business profile this is kind of like the merchant category code if you don't want your users to need to look this up and you're facilitating kind of the same kind of industry or Merchant category across all your connected accounts then you can set a business profile MCC code which makes the most sense so here let's take a look and see if we can figure out some like digital Goods which is in this case it's going to be something like digital media so maybe this this one might work you'll have to consult a tax professional or you know go go ask for someone with legal experience to look up and make sure that you're using the correct MCC but this is something that we can include so we'll go back to our API reference this is under the business profile the MCC is going to be this value here we can also set the name and we'll set the name to current user.name the product description is going to be email newsletters and potentially we could put in a support address support email Etc so we'll say that the support email is their email address we don't have their phone number the URL we can pass in as like root URL which will ultimately be the URL of the newsletter platform if in the future we wanted to have some like sub domains for each author or subdomaine for each newsletter we could get really fancy with this to make sure that those are passed in correctly but for now that should be a good start we also have the idea of a default currency some settings for the account and so this this should get us pretty far all right so we've pre-filled quite a bit for the account now one thing that we have not pre-filled is the recipient service agreement now this recipient service agreement is really critical if you want to enable your connect platform to expand globally now this only works for uh I I it's my understanding this only works for us-based platforms but this and this is the key to enabling to be able to send transfers to folks outside of the us so we want to change we want to set this terms of EX terms of service acceptance to the service agreement of recipient now it's a little odd because you only set this for accounts that are being created outside of the US so if it's a if the country is U.S so let's actually pull off country and we'll say params count country dot up case and here we can pass in country and so it's like if the country is equal to U.S then we want to use recipient or then we want to use full otherwise we want to use recipient so we'll see if this works as expected this is not a symbol that's okay so we'll see if the ternary operation works okay so then after we have this new account the next step is to create an account link so we're going to say link is stripe account link dot create and it requires four different parameters at a minimum we want the account ID a refresh URL a return URL the type is account onboarding so those are the four minimum that you want to pass in I also like to pass in um what to collect and instead of currently do I like to use eventually do the difference is that if you only say currently do then there's a chance that they will have to answer fewer questions when going through onboarding by saying eventually do we're going to collect everything that we might need in order for them to succeed given the the current setup of their account okay now we want to store the account ID in the database so we can say currentuser.accounts.create and we'll say the stripe account ID is this and that should be a good start and then finally we want to redirect to the link.url and the status is going to be 301 allow we have to tell this to allow other hosts and let's actually I think it's gonna by using redirect it should set the status for us automatically okay so this is going to do two two things so it's going to make an API call to stripe it's going to make another API called the stripe and then we're going to redirect and hopefully we should store this in the database now I didn't go to the user model so you have to head over to the user model and make sure that we have this Association set up for accounts let's go to user and a user is going to has many counts and the foreign key again on this one is going to be author ID and we want to go to the account side of this and say that the account belongs to an author but the class name is actually a user and I don't know if we need the foreign key so this should be this should be okay now what we want to do is go to our accounts new view and say like you know connect your stripe account and then maybe we have a form where the action is slash counts method Post in this case let's go grab some Tailwind UI we actually want like a list of countries so let's go look at some form controls for select menus and Yeah we actually will need to figure out the whole list of countries but for now this is going to be fine and instead of location we want to say country and the name here is going to be count colon ER country inside of square brackets and then for us we're going to have the value here be US Canada let's also do IE for Ireland and that'll be let this at least we can start testing with this we can always come back and populate the rest of the countries that are supported so this should at least get us started so now if we go to routes we need to make sure that we have uh resources accounts so that we can go to slash accounts and we have appending migration so let's run our migration rails DB migrate and authors does not exist right okay that's because in create accounts we didn't update this foreign key to have the two table of users all right that migrated the database and now we have this uniqueness constraint so let's refresh ah capabilities doesn't have a comma after it so accounts controller capabilities here all right let's try this again okay so this is our accounts index so if we go to account Slash new all right we have a drop down list we don't have a button yet because this is going to submit using turbo and we want to redirect server side we might need to disable turbo and we might need to include a csrf token in that case but we will look at that in just a minute after we grab one of these beautiful buttons I like this middle one and we're going to set the type to submit and here this is going to be um create a stripe count all right and we'll give it some actually let's make this a space by four I think that should work okay all right so connect your stripe account we have the country if we pick let's pick the US for now and then say create a stripe account ah right so stripe we haven't installed the stripe ruby gem so we gotta go do that next bundle add stripe okay now I need to go over to the stripe dashboard I'm going to go to my developers tab to the API Keys section and I need to grab both my publishable and my secret key and where I'm going to put those is inside of my rails credentials so here we're going to say stripe secret key and publishable key so our secret key is this one it starts with an SK test in our publishable key is this one and that should be good we close that and that will finish encrypting our credentials now what we can do is open up config initializers stripe.rb and globally set our API key to rails.application.credentials.dig stripe secret key so that will globally set our API key and it should have installed the gems we need to restart the server we've got a new server up and running let's come back over to our controller and hit refresh now we say create a stripe account invalid in accounts controller create stripe account create not a valid URL so the URL property that we're trying to pass in as this root URL is going to be a local host URL and our accounts this API call is expecting something that is actually public so for now I'm just going to set cjab.gov and we should be okay so let's refresh the page all right click on create stripe account okay notice how it didn't actually redirect us if we look at the logs here we started processing this we created an account I believe and then we tried to redirect to the URL here but it didn't actually redirect because this was being processed as a turbo stream so this form was being processed as a turbo stream and that is not going to redirect um client side it's not going to get redirected the same way that we are trying to server side so one way that we can fix this is by going to our account new form and disabling Turbo with data turbo is false um this is going to create a second account so let's yeah let's keep this in US create an account ah now we see this can't verify csrf authenticity token because when turbo is disabled and it's not being submitted as a turbo stream it doesn't have the csrf information so we need to add a hidden input with the name is authenticity token and the value is going to be form authenticity token this is something that comes from from rails to provide csrf protection refresh the page here and if we were to inspect the form now you'll notice that there's this hidden input that has this authenticity token value that will also be passed to the server when we try to create a stripe account and the controllers are verifying the csrf tokens and now we are redirected to our onboarding flow okay fantastic but I don't actually want to go through or test out onboarding yet because we haven't set up connect web hooks so that is the next step in the process here so we are ready to start handling connect web hooks let's go the let's go check the database and see if our last account has a stripe ID and it does and it correctly has charges are all disabled and transfers are disabled so at this point we're looking pretty good the next thing we could do here is open up accounts index and just list out all of the accounts that we've attempted to connect for this user so again this might be a table similar to what we have in the newsletter index I'm just going to grab this whole thing paste it in okay a list of all the accounts you have connected and we probably only really want one active account so we'll have to figure out how we want to handle that the account here will just say stripe account ID as what we want to print out and we'll do the same thing actually we'll just remove the stream the screen reader part here because we don't really have anything all right so we were redirected back to accounts new that is our refresh URL so now we have two accounts that are sort of set up one thing that we can do here is add another column for the um the statuses so like uh charges enabled transfers enabled onboarding complete and then we can add a couple of columns here with like charges enabled transfers enabled onboarding complete details submitted is kind of the same thing as onboardingcomplete all right so now we have the account ID charges enabled transfers enabled um so one thing we could do is if onboarding is not complete we can add maybe a button here that will bring us back through another account link so let's let's add some some quick a quick little thing here so we can say something like if Account Details are not submitted then we want to have a form where the action is going to be something like account links yeah I'm wondering if we want the update action to actually redirect us or if we should just create a new controller for the account links let's just yeah so let's start with account links and we're going to have we need to have a hidden input again for the csrf token so we'll just grab that from here gosh GitHub copilot is uh sort of freaking out here all right so we have our hidden input for the csrf token then we're going to add something that just is a button type submit that is going to finish onboarding and we'll give this the same classes as we used for the last one we might actually want it a little bit smaller so we'll grab this first one here all right let's see what we got okay so now we have these finished onboarding buttons so for this one if we click the button right now there is no account links URL so we need to go create that say data turbo is false for this one also because it does need to redirect to a new URL rails G controller account links all right and the account links controller is going to have a create method we're going to require that the user is authenticated and we're going to say string account links create the account is going to be rims account ID and then we want to pass in the same arguments that we are passing here so those four okay so here we have our link and then our redirect is going to be the same and now we need we just need to make sure that we are also passing the account ID down when we click on that button so if we go to our accounts index and we look at the button here we also want to have an input type hidden where the name is Count ID and the value is account.id let's see what this looks like okay so now if we click on finish onboarding we we need our route okay okay post uh okay that account ID is missing account links controller this should be rims count ID uh uh no such count one oh that's because this account ID is not actually the this is the database ID stripe account ID we want that to be the string value um of the stripe account okay so now if we say finish onboarding nice we are redirected through the onboarding flow that's great okay so at this point I think we're ready to start handling some web hooks we'll come back in the next episode we will start handling connect web hooks so that we know when an account finishes this onboarding flow and we know when they can start accepting payments so stick around and thanks so much for watching foreign [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'xN79dwF-rOE', 'title': 'Stripe Connect account onboarding', 'description': 'Unknown',

recently made PayPal as a payment method available in Europe the UK and Switzerland if you have a connect account first reach out to support to see if you're eligible but if you're a Direct Merchant meaning if you accept payments directly from consumers let's go through the steps to enable it [Music] and foremost you need to have a stripe account registered in the EU UK or Switzerland to be able to activate PayPal you will also need a PayPal business account in one of those 32 countries in the stripe dashboard navigate to the payment method settings page and if you're eligible you should see the PayPal option listed under the wallet section click the turn on button to start the onboarding process select where you'd like to keep your PayPal funds and click the button to connect and activate your accounts in order to accept Paypal payments on stripe you will need a PayPal business account if you don't already have one you can create it during the onboarding process or log in using your existed Account Details if it's a new PayPal account be sure to complete all the account opening steps required by PayPal once this is done if you're logged into an existed account you should see the green check mark on the right to indicate that your PayPal account has been connected to stripe successfully from there you can also contact support if you need to change how your funds are settled you can turn this feature off at any time by clicking the turn off button if you created a new PayPal account as part of the onboarding flow it will first be marked as pending until you confirm your email address so make sure to check your inbox if you're mostly using Stripes not good product like payment link this is all you need to do PayPal will now be a payment option for all your customers to test it out you can select one of your products copy its payment link open it in a new tab and verify that the PayPal option is displayed now if you're using our API and sdks you can configure your integration to display PayPal as a payment method with just a few changes to your code first if you're using checkout locate where you're creating a session using strike.checkout.sessions.create in your code base if you are already specifying different payment methods using the payment method types attribute all you need to do is add PayPal to your array by default if you don't specify any payment method types it will display all payment methods enabled including PayPal if you're using the payment element look at where you're creating the payment intent using stripe.paymentints.create if you have the attribute automatic payment methods set to enabled PayPal will show up as an option automatically otherwise if you're using the payment method types attribute to customize your options you'll only need to add PayPal to the array and you'll be good to go Additionally you can update your payment element to to always show PayPal permanently by using the payment method order attribute finally if you want to make checkout faster and easier for your customers you can also add Express checkout to your product pages by specifying the better version when declaring your publishable key setting the attribute mode to payment when providing options to create the payment element and adding a div with ID Express checkout element in your front end the code sample shown in this video are using node.js but the changes are very similar in other programming languages if you want to read more please check our documentation now what if you want to refund a customer to do this select the payment you'd like to issue a refund for in the stripe dashboard click on the refund button in the top right and confirm when you issue a refund stripe will use your available balance not including your pending balance so if you don't have enough funds in your available balance to cover the amount of the refund strike will debit the remaining amount from your bank account and that's it you can now enable PayPal as a payment method with stripe in a few clicks and some minor code changes if you're interested in reading more about this feel free to check our docs

watching the newsletter platform being built right before your eyes and this is going to be a way that creators can send email newsletters and monetize their email newsletters so that they can they can make a little bit of money on the side so in the last episode we went through the process of building out create an update for newsletters now we want to add the idea of a newsletter issue but before we do so what I wanted to do was add in some styling because so far we have no landing page and everything is kind of like a little bit messy notice this is sort of our UI right now we can see our list of newsletters we can add a newsletter we can edit a newsletter and you can't really tell where the form starts and form stops so we're going to use Tailwind UI throughout the series and there are a bunch of pre-built application components and marketing components so the first thing we might want to do is just grab sort of like a landing page so I'm going to search for landing page and we'll take a look at some of these landing page examples a lot of these things that come directly from Tailwind UI are just so beautiful right out of the box that you can kind of grab some of them and then go off to the races without too much worry or stress so there are several new landing page examples in here which are great so with screenshots and stats new okay so which ones do we want deploy the cloud okay so this one looks pretty cool I like the style here it's also pretty long so we'll need to go through and just chop out the stuff that we don't need for the code I'm going to use HTML I'm going to grab the whole thing it is worth noting that Tailwind UI is a paid package I'm using Tailwind UI so that we don't have to fuss too much with styling and we can get to the root of the project which is really just like building newsletter reading sending and how you build out the monetization so let's start by opening up our root HTML ERB this is our marketing landing page and let's paste in all of that code from Tailwind UI and then we can head over to our application and just look at what this landing page looks like it looks pretty beautiful so the screenshot that's on the right we will eventually want to change this to be our newsletter platform UI that we want that we're proud of sharing and then we can kind of come through a lot of this copy and update it later now get started this can jump right to sort of the authentication we can remove live demo and then we're going to start just chopping out many of these pieces that we're not going to use as part of this demo so here we have the hero section at the top we have like a few different sections here's this feature section this is going to tell you kind of like the list of features right so we have deploy faster so deploy faster okay so everything you need to deploy your app and then below that we have server monitoring and collaborate and some other things so server monitoring collaborate we're just going to like remove um huge swaths of this so feature section uh feature section uh stats maybe we'll keep a stats for now so we've refresh okay trusted yeah whatever instead of deploy to the cloud with confidence we'll say like um monetize monitize your audience the most powerful newsletter platform for meters whatever this is close enough um okay so get started in live demo so instead of live demo we're just going to remove that entirely get started we'll send this to user slash sign up and so now when we say get started oh you're already signed in okay so here what we can actually do is say like if user signed in then we want to show them something otherwise we'll show them that button so if they're signed in let's send them to uh Slash news letters and let's actually use the same Button as it has for the call to action and instead of get started we'll say like your dashboard okay so now we can see your dashboard and that's your newsletters and now we have the world's most Innovative companies use our app so the world's okay so we want to remove the logo Cloud because we don't have any logos yet our track record trusted by thousands of authors worldwide okay we'll just leave like the warm ipsum there then for this we'll say like authors on the platform one really cool thing you can do too is just say like um user account I don't know right like that's right now there's just one author um you probably also want to check and make sure that this person actually has a newsletter um whatever daily requests maybe this is like daily emails or something daily emails send uptime guaranteed newsletters created this one we can probably do again like uh newsletter.com there we go this is looking pretty good whatever boost your productivity start your app today so we can remove this call to action section um probably not something necessarily you want to remove in practice but it's fine okay and then it has this footer your company All rights Reserve blah blah blah that's one thing I noticed from this call to active call to action section is that it had some height that I think is important before the uh the footer so we'll just leave that for now and then down here instead of having all of these different things um we can remove all of those icons or uh or just comment them out or whatever so let's just see all right your company Inc all right it's reserved here we go all right so let's go back to our dashboard now now this is fine for the for like the public facing landing page right this is for like our our application landing page but what we want to do is make sure that we also have like a dashboard shell for the rest of our views and so one thing that we can do is go into um these components here and let's say that we want to like I don't know navigation right because we want some concept of a like an application shell uh yeah so application shell is going to give us different layouts so do we want the sidebar layout a stacked layout multi-column layout Etc I think this sidebar layout looks pretty sweet so we can just go in here pick one of these that seems like it looks nice this one looks really clean I like the light background and the light sidebar so let's copy the HTML and instead of dropping that directly onto a specific page we're going to use the layout so application HTML Erb and we'll drop it inside of the layout here and we're going to need to clean some stuff up so this says this example requires that your HTML has this class H full and same thing with your body and this yield is where the like the actual sub page stuff is being rendered and so we're going to want to put that in a different place so if we go back over to slash newsletters uh we're being asked to log in and we can't really see the page anymore okay so let's move this yield inside of the shell so here where it says your content um that's where we're going to put yield probably also don't need like the round stuff around it okay here we've got this dashboard we have our um this view profile Tom Cook Etc we can up we can update and edit like a lot of these different things you'll also notice that this is uh like sort of already mobile friendly um so if you want to make it like work on small devices and things we need to add a little bit of JavaScript but for now we just want to like log back in so that we can see our new dashboard team project calendar documents Etc we'll instead of just using the default here we can render this a different way or we can like manually Co like hard code some of these but this is looking like a pretty decent shell now when we go to like add we want to make sure that our forms are also looking pretty clean Tailwind UI has some tools for that also so we can go back to like components and look at forms and inside of forms I like to just kind of like most of the time I'll just grab sort of input groups so for instance this is pretty clean we don't actually need help labels for most of the time so we can grab that go back over to our our newsletter new and replace it with this sort of drop in so and then instead of uh like these are the the type and name that we need so we can just grab those and replace this and the ID here needs to match the ID on the label for accessibility so that when you click on the label it will also Focus the input so if we say add now clicking on the label focuses the input so that's pretty cool but one thing that we're noticing is that like this is a little bit off right like the way that it looks is just a tiny bit off that's because we need to update our Tailwind config.js to add this plugin at tailwindcss form so if we go to Tailwind config you'll notice that here we need to add this plugins and it should have like required tail and CSS forms as soon as I save this though I think it crashes yeah so this is going to crash my CSS bundling Builder thing because it doesn't know what this module is so we have to kill our server say npm install dash dash save tail and CSS forms and now when we refresh we actually have two inputs here so this is the old input and this is the new input and you can tell now like the spacing around this looks really crisp when you click on title it focuses the input so all of that is looking good we do want to probably remove this comment and then also this input and we are going to want to change the placeholder text so one thing that I like to do is is when working with Tailwind CSS um the class property on most inputs becomes really long and so to make this like manageable I try to put all the other props um closer like near the front basically on the left so type Name ID placeholder literally any other value I want to put um to the left of class always have class as the last prop just so it's more readable also if it is a an element that contains like children I always line break so you can kind of see it so it's yeah it can be helpful so here we can just say like a Plucky title for your subscribers all right so if we refresh and now our create newsletter button is not very fun so we can also grab some um some submit text from Tailwind UI there's also components for buttons so we can take a look at these buttons here maybe we want like that middle one so just grab like this middle button and drop that in and again we can remove this is what I meant by like nesting or like if if see how this button element has like some child content anytime we're using Tailwind in this class thing it's really long I like to put that inside here um okay and instead of type button we actually want this to be type submit so that it will submit the form come back over here refresh looking pretty good but these are too friendly way too friendly uh we need some space between those right so let's just add like I don't know mt4 to add some margin top to the button so it looks yeah it has some breathing room right breathing room okay so this is going to be like test or like my newsletter two create newsletter boom all right so now we have multiple newsletters fantastic okay moving on let's also clean this up so this needs to be a list right so we have a couple different options for lists um there is description lists we can also do stacked list grid lists tables in this case I mean most of the stuff that I'm building ends up in tables anyway so um if we could just grab a simple table here with an edit link this looks pretty good here is the code for it let's just copy that HTML and go to our newsletters index and we'll drop that in okay so as we're iterating over our list of newsletters we want to say a list of all the newsletters You author or something like that and then here we have a button and the button goes to add user and the type is button but instead of button I want to use a link because I want this to just go to slash newsletters Slash new so that we can replace this link that we had before okay now for each row in the table we only care about the title of the thing so let's change this first one to title we'll move the rest and then we'll have edit as like the third column so we're going to have this is going to be the title of the newsletter again we'll just make a a new line here oops and we'll say newsletter dot dot title it had this concept of like odd column and even column and for each of the rows we want to do this so at newsletters dot each do newsletter all right this should give us something something a little bit prettier than what we had before okay newsletters a list of newsletters that you author add a user that should we add we use a letter and now we can take this away okay and I don't know it's a little funky that it has this spacing to the left um so I think PX4 yeah like we want to take away all of that let's see there we go that's nicer the other thing that we want to do is make sure that these edit links really work and so right now the the href for these should be edit newsletter path for the newsletter okay we have edit and then we'll remove the name okay so that should be good we actually don't need that span at all well actually okay let's leave this band this is for screen readers only and then we'll put in newsletter.title so that it makes it nicer okay now we can say edit newsletter three two three so you'll notice that we we kind of need to make the same or similar changes to this form that we did to the new form instead of using uh or like instead of re-implementing the form twice what I want to do is extract this form into a a partial that we're going to use on both the new and edit page we'll say add new form.html.erb notice that the file name is going to start with an underscore that in rails like convention is a partial now between new and edit there's a couple differences the first is that the the path where we're submitting the request is different so we could actually just say something like path is equal to if the newsletter is persisted at which is letter dot per assisted so if it's persisted then the path should be newsletter path for at newsletter otherwise it should be newsletters path that will make sure that we have the right path so if the newsletter is in the database then we're going to use like newsletters slash one or newsletters slash two that's like the the route where we're going to send the update request if it's not persisted that means we're creating a brand new one then it's going to go to this news like slash newsletters thing so now we can just say path instead and if we go to our edit route here instead of having the form on our new and edit route here we can just say like render render form and now we get like this super clean thing that's already filled out but the other piece of the puzzle is that we lost our value so inside of the the input for the title we also need to add a value since placeholder is kind of long I'm going to put the value here value is going to be at news letter dot title now when we refresh the page it's pre-populated with the correct thing and finally we want to do something like if at newsletter dot persisted we want to display one thing otherwise One display another thing and so this is going to be like update newsletter okay let's see all right so now now we see that it says update there and we can also go back to our edit form um oh one other thing that we need to do is recall that if it's an update we need to do this thing here so if it is persisted then we want to put in this hidden input that tells it that it is persistent now what's cool is we can use the same form for new and update so let's go back over to our new view and we can replace this whole thing with render form so let's update this newsletter test123 four five six seven whatever update boom okay so that was updated now let's try to make a new one testing again create newsletter boom all right so this is working pretty well so our dashboard by default when we click on this dashboard thing on the side nav I think it should bring us to our list of newsletters but it's also potential potentially a use case where we want to have a separate dashboard view or if you were mostly a reader you would expect your dashboard to be the list of all of the most recent issues probably from new newsletters you subscribe to so we'll have to come back and rethink about whether or not we want the dashboard view to actually be this but um we definitely want to have probably some like list of newsletters and issues that we have authored off on the left there the other thing is that this totally broke our root route right like if we look at the root now now our landing page is inside of our application UI so how do we fix that well let's go and jump into our static Pages controller and here what we could do is we could say layout uh marketing and we can create a separate layout so inside of views layouts right now there is the application layout that is like the default one and that's where we added most of our sort of like Tailwind UI Shell Code there is also we can also copy Apple this this whole application HTML Erb and make a new marketing dot html.erb template where we paste in basically all of the same stuff and then um just remove everything except the notices we have our marketing page it's looking pretty good if we click your dashboard now we're brought to the dashboard that's also looking pretty good um I need to figure out the sizing here but okay let's also clean up the side nav here so if we go back to application HTML Erb you'll notice that like inside of this sidebar we have like dashboard and we have team so here instead of Team let's change this to newsletters um there's also going to be like different icons that we can use I think these are from hero icons so for slash for the newsletters uh navigation item let's just call it newsletters and then that'll bring us to slash newsletters and then for the dashboard let's make this go to slash dashboard and we may or may not come back and Implement a new dashboard concept but for now we can go to the pages controller and say layout dashboard and go to the views for pages and just say like your dashboard okay so now if we click on dashboard oh we need a route for this it's going to be something like get slash dashboard to Pages dashboard okay and uh undefined method layout oh right so inside of our Pages controller we can't use this layout method directly in inside of the action instead we need to say like render dashboard layout application and that should work okay so this is our dashboard so we can jump between the dashboard and newsletters and back to the dashboard we also want to have some something called like issues so here we can say instead of projects we'll say issues and then we're also going to want some like payments thing and then billing and we'll just like remove this last one from the side and yeah okay so this is looking pretty good I I like this icon for subscribers so let's also add another thing here that's like I don't know your like audience and maybe we'll show them a list of subscribers but for now we'll just leave this back at um the pound sign as we're getting organized and then a better icon for newsletters we can go find at heroic heroicons email all right so newsletters I don't know letter okay that looks cool all right so we're going to copy the SVG and we're just going to paste it in here and we're gonna grab the CSS that was used on the previous one and make sure that we sort of match it and then we'll remove that and see how that looks in the sidebar so now newsletters has the email icon that's pretty cool audience has the people issues is a folder that should probably also be some sort of email thing like send yeah maybe this paper airplane so we'll copy that and drop that in grab the CSS again and then delete old icon I'm also thinking it makes sense for issues to be above audience um this is all just I don't know we're just kind of like hacking away at it trying to make it look good all right and then we have payments and billing let's see if there's any nice like payment all right um payments well I dollars is very U.S Centric but we will use it for now all right we'll grab this CSS once more drop that in and then delete those okay how's it looking now looks great billing let's see if there's a billing thing building Library bank is there a bank thing um Bank notes I don't know let's see copy that that's fine all right all right so we've got some beautiful navigation here that seems to make sense we have our newsletters we can create um and edit those we've got issues which we we don't actually have the idea or concept of sending a newsletter issue yet but things are looking more stylish than they did before we can do a couple more things so like down here in the bottom left so back in application HTML Erb instead of Tom Cook we can say current user.name there's going to be a mobile version and the non-mobile version so we will actually need to make the same changes that we just made to this side navigation to like the mobile menu right like we have yeah again we see team and projects and et cetera et cetera so we'll have to come back and make sure that we have both our mobile menu and our main menu working as expected all right is there anything else that we want to do I guess like if we were to go to users sign out and we're signed out successfully if we tried to like get started um something went wrong what is going on undefined name all right because devise is also going to use this same controller and no one is logged in yet we probably also want maybe a special layout for devise so we could say something like um let's grab the marketing layout um oh yeah so let's just use the marketing layout for device so it turns out that if we call our layout devise then it will be used by default so device.html.earb and we'll just paste that in okay we will need to clean this up which there's probably part of tailing UI that will be helpful here for like registration yeah sign in and registration you're so there's like full-on views so um at least to start one thing we could do is like make the background gray and some other really basic things um where we can sort of like wrap up everything in this sort of container that starts to look just a little bit better so if we look back at the preview here um right okay so then what we want inside of this box is going to be after this 14 day free trial thing and so one thing that we could do pretty simply I think is just make everything inside of that type of container basically trying to make as small of changes as possible so we don't have to like fully customize all these views but they still will look pretty good okay let's see all right so this is not this is not horrible um and should work just fine for our use cases let's go log in here we go jenny.rosnetexample.com password password okay signed in successfully is showing up up here but whatever that's that's fine um and now we can see our dashboard basically I'm pretty happy with the the sort of core styling that we've done so far I will probably go and do some more cleanup off camera but this should give you a good idea for how you can use Tailwind UI to sort of really quickly build out and clean up your um your interfaces in the next episode we will tackle the next step here which is authoring a newsletter issue so stick around for that and we'll see in the next one foreign

releasing a new version of the stripe node SDK and Annie who's here from the SDK team is going to tell us all about it so Annie what do you have for us today yeah so we made several improvements to the striped node SDK over the past T1 Center decided to share with you today these improvements include easier out of the box compatibility in serverless environments like Cloud workers native es model support and with the latest vtel major version API version pinning awesome well let's head over to your screen and take a look at it so one of the things that we've improved in stripe node is usability in serverless environments specifically collabo workers um sorry for a bit of context club workers are environments that allow you to deploy serverless JavaScript apps uh before you have you would have had to do some extra configuration to sub out node specific implementations or web compatible ones so on my screen I have a small template for handling what book events in clockworkers on my left is what you would have had to do before which is to configure alternative implementations yourself like the HTTP client when initializing stripe and the encrypted provider when constructing events so you would have also had a chair on the notepad option to get other node polyfills but on the right you can see that the configurations are no longer needed in stripe node so now we do this implementation switching internally depending on your record environment so there should be no difference in how you call striper across platforms nice so like you said if I'm building anything with like cloudflare workers or any type of serverless type of thing I could just use the stripe node SDK as it is and I don't have to do any additional setup which I think is great because if I take a look at what you're showing us right now it's actually less code for me to write and I'm a big fan of having less things to maintain yeah I am too nice why don't you talk to us about like the es module support you mentioned yeah so another area that we worked on is native support for ES modules so let's check this package now ships as a dual common JS and Es module package which gives certain users access to the benefits of BS modules it opens up more visual work that depended on ASM support so one nice side effect of this the stripe node package takes up less space in your bundle when imported as an eth module here I have a side-by-side breakdown of a bundle built with es build for a small project that sends a request of type node on the left the project uses the old comma.js build circuit and on the right we have a product that Imports the updated es module version the type node and as you can see the total size of the bundle has been reduced by over 60 kilobytes and the short note package takes about 30 less space in your bundle I think this is going to be particularly exciting for folks that are building applications that run in resource constrained environments maybe like containers or something like that so being able to have a little bit more space to run my application is going to be like a game changer for folks yeah so this is super exciting and it also opens up several other streams of work uh the first is better support for alternative JS runtimes like Deno uh that have some restrictions around es modules so for example this issue I have open deals running better type support in Ronaldo uh so that's something that we like to support in future and provide a better experience for users there another feature that we like to support or uh is tree shaking which is a feature uniquely offered by es modules and will help further reduce sides that swipe known takes up in your project so I love how by default the stripe node SDK is already saving me space in the model but now with this particular feature we're going to be able to save even more space for tree shaking so again like for folks that are building an application building applications that need to go to places where I don't actually have a lot of space like this is going to be great for them and they're going to just have more flexibility when they're deploying their applications yeah super excited stuff right so I think there's one more thing we wanted to talk about yeah so we just shipped a new major version of tripod with an API version pinning feature so if you aren't familiar with API versions your API version controls the API and what book behavior that you see so every few months stripe releases a new API version named after date that it was released like the most recent one 2020 to 11 15. uh before if you didn't specify an API version explicitly when initializing select node should I put default to the account API version set under dashboard uh some of you just found this Behavior confusing because the version 1 specified in code anywhere it wasn't in your application code and it wasn't even an instructor of source code but starting with striped version 12 stripe node will default to sending the API version that was the latest at the time the SDK version was released this means that when you up here type node to the new major version in your packages on you'll also be upgrading your API version at the same time uh this will make version upgrade easy to understand help prevent your integration from accidentally falling out of date and also help ensure that the doc strings and type the type you see in your ID are accurate I think this is really cool because that means that anytime going forward that I update my stripe note SDK to whatever the newest versions are I am going to get support for the latest versions of the stripe API so whatever the most up-to-date version is that's what we're going to be supporting by default so now the only thing that I really need to do is make sure that my actual stripe account is set to you know that corresponding API version and then we'll be Off to the Races yeah yeah so to reiterate um V12 you should also upgrade your integration to use the most recent search API version uh which may be a more involved upgrade than an up uh any other major version upgrade you've done in the past so for help with upgrading your API version you can refer to this API upgrades page in our Docs and if you like to upgrade to start node V12 aren't ready to upgrade API version just yet you can still override the API version manually on the striped client with the caveat that your SDK version API version are going to be equally aligned awesome Annie thank you so much for coming on and talking to us about some of the new features that developers can expect in a new version of the striped node SDK and for those of you that are watching definitely make sure that you check head over to our docs check out how to use our sdks check out our API versions and just in general so you can learn what exactly it is you can do with some of these upgraded versions of the stripe API now if you have any questions or concerns definitely make sure you head over to our GitHub recall photo stripe node SDK you can submit issues you can give us some feedback or even just let us know what you're building I hope you upgrade and let us know how it goes [Music] thank you [Music] foreign\", metadata={'source': 'Tr4ORJZ8DFg', 'title': 'Stripe Node v12 Released', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 1272,

going to build a checkout flow for a single product in this case we're going to sell a box of chocolates from a candy store that I've already set up inside a stripe we're going to use a tool from our documentation called the integration Builder this will allow us to download some example code and in just a couple minutes we'll be up and running with a checkout integration so let's get started [Music] I'm going to start by going into the account settings section of my dashboard and looking at the Account Details under my business settings I want to confirm that my business information is correct and that what customers will see is accurate so I'll look at both my account details and the public details confirming the support email support phone number and statement descriptors I'll also take a look at the brand settings notice that I've already set an icon a logo and some brand colors and accents that will appear in checkout when customers are going through this payment flow finally I want to confirm that customer email settings are up to date as expected so I will toggle on successful payments and refunds and scroll down to save that way customers will receive emails when they purchase my products finally we'll head over to the products section and note that we've already created this product listing for a dark chocolate collection so we're going to sell a dozen pieces of our most popular 48v signature chocolate this is the price ID that we'll use when creating the checkout session later to get started quickly on our app we'll use Stripes integration Builder this is a tool that's in the docs that's going to give us a fully working example of a stripe checkout integration to get to the integration Builder we'll head over to payments and then select accept online payments today we're going to use HTML on the front end and Java on the back end we also want to confirm that we are still logged into our account which we can see in the top right corner next we can scroll down and Define a product that we want to sell by selecting from this drop down or adding a new test product note that when I select a product its price ID is set in the line items and we'll come back and talk more about this in a bit next we can scroll up to download the full app the code that's included in this app will also have our API key and the price ID for the product pre-configured all right let's take a look at what's in the download so we have this public directory off on the left here with a CSS file and three HTML files now from stripe checkout the customer will be redirected to either this success or cancel page depending on whether or not they actually made a purchase our checkout HTML page is where the customer will preview their order so let's go take a look at this we see some HTML to display the product but right now it's just showing the example product not hours so we want to update the image URL and the product information here now right below the productive we can see a submit button that when clicked is going to call our server route create checkout session so let's head over and take a look at our server at the very top we see several different dependencies first of all we're using the spark web server we are also importing stripe and some classes for interacting with checkout sessions and building the params that we're going to send when creating the API call to create a checkout session you can also see that my test secret key has already been set that's because I was logged into my account when I downloaded the code from the integration Builder now if this isn't set you'll need to go into the stripe dashboard get your API keys and update it now our server has just one route at the moment the one we saw referenced in checkout.html and that is this create checkout session this route is going to make an API call to stripe to create the checkout session object which controls what the customer will see on the payment flow now there's a lot of different parameters you can include when you're creating a checkout session but for this example we're going to keep it very simple and focus on just those required parameters so first we set the mode on the checkout session this tell us check out what type of payment we're going to be making this is set to payment here because the customer is going to make a one-time purchase of our chocolates but this could also be set to something else if we had a different pricing model for example if we wanted to charge customers later or set up recurring payments we can control that with the mode next we're going to set some URLs that stripe will redirect our customer to from the checkout page these are set to the success and cancel HTML Pages for our app finally we pass in the line items array this is the parameter you'll use to define a list of line items the customer will purchase in this case we're just passing one item and the integration Builder has already pre-populated the params with a line item instance of the quantity of one and a price parameter set to our price ID once the checkout session has been created we're going to return a response that tells the browser to redirect to this newly created checkout session URL we're going to head back into the terminal here and to install our dependencies we'll run Maven package then we'll fire up the server with Java CP key Target with sample jar with dependencies.jar and then we're going to pass this class path of com.stripe.sample.server this will start our server running on localhost 4242 which we can open up in the browser head over to localhost 4242 checkout.html and when we click on the checkout button here we're taken to stripe checkout and I can see the product information enter a test card to complete the purchase thank you so much for watching please be sure to head over to the documentation and take a look at the other videos in this series to learn more about what you can do with stripe checkout see in the next one [Music] thank you foreign\", metadata={'source': 'D0xdvGwKQiw', 'title': 'Accept a payment with Checkout and the Integration Builder

exciting you won't want to miss but first I wanted to make sure that you knew about a couple of tools that I personally can't live without the stripe CLI and the striper vs code extension these enable you to interact with stripe directly from your terminal to do things like bootstrap sample projects or send test mode API requests in this case we're retrieving a subscription now I'm personally a big fan of the listen command which is really helpful for building and testing those web hooks locally we've also got all the same power of the CLI built into the striper vs code extension and last year we brought the CLI into the browser when we introduced the stripe shell giving you the power of the stripe CLI without having to leave the dashboard or the docs today I'm excited to introduce the new API Explorer now you can craft API calls with this tidy UI on the left hand side including building really complex nested arguments with hashes or arrays and as you're editing the arguments on the left you'll see the stripe CLI command synchronized on the right we can do things like create a customer we can copy that customer's ID and use it to create a checkout session we can even see helpful error messages directly in this terminal that's inside the browser we can even redirect directly to this checkout sessions URL inside the browser without ever leaving the docs or the dashboard but my favorite feature of all is Cogen once you're happy with the arguments you've configured print the SDK code and copy it right into your project and you're on to the next task if you're like me and you have a hard time remembering syntax this is going to be a game changer the stripe shell and the API Explorer they've already saved me a ton of time I'm really excited to see what you're going to build

Document(page_content=\"thank you [Music] hi everyone my name is Cecil Phillip and we're still here at the Caribbean developers conference in Punta Cana where we're talking to tons of developers and folks that are involved in the community all learning and you know talking about technology and I have my friend here who I just met like a couple of days ago she has some really cool things to talk to us about yeah so why don't you just really quick introduce yourself and let folks know who you are and what do you do hi everyone my name is Leela Squires and I'm a developer Advocate at bitrise and I recently started as a developer Advocate before that I was an iOS Developer at using bitrise so familiar with the CI CD Pipeline and so recently I decided to get into developer Advocate advocacy and it's been a world world of Adventure so far I mean I'm at this beautiful place that's very cool so I'd love to know how did you get started in technology in the beginning um it's kind of a long story there and it's not necessarily traditional in the sense so I started as a customer service the position the title doesn't really matter because it's not a real title um but it was at a startup at the time I was the 30th person hired I was the first person hired that wasn't someone that knew a person at the company and it was really awesome really fun days and so slowly we started getting bigger and bigger our technology started getting more and more more more and more robust and there was a need for data checks is what they were calling them which now looking back it was Data QA and it wasn't something that I knew about I didn't really know much about tech didn't understand how to make an app let alone B become a iOS Developer and so I started doing that they hired QA she told me hey you're doing data QA you can make a lot of money once you have that data QA title why don't you come on over to the engineering department and see if we can work something out okay so then that turned into becoming just a manual tester and then I started learning automation for our testing our testing structure and um so just learning Java and I started working with our mobile team specifically doing the UI test and that turned into me finding bugs and them being only a team of about four they were like we don't have time to fix these little bugs can you do it yeah okay I know exactly where the bug is in the code so I right sure so then I started fixing these small UI bugs started really falling in love with iOS development created some smaller apps on my own and then I got the chance and the opportunity to interview in-house for an iOS position and I got it and I was doing that for almost a decade oh sorry half a decade and then I went over to bitrize you know what I love about that story is like you was talking about how you started and someone giving you the opportunity of someone seeing something in you to be able to be like oh you know what you'll be really good at this and I really wish that all of us like in the industry and even in other Industries as well would do that with more people yes because a lot of the times it's just it's just giving folks the opportunity right and more than just oh okay well I just happen to know you because you're my friend yeah we went to school together or you're my cousin uncle sister brother or whatever you know I mean sometimes it's just like we just need folks to to give us an opportunity and then you know it's amazing what can happen after that yeah yeah and um that's actually some of the biggest advice that I give to others who are looking to like break into Tech I always say I snuck through the back door of tech but it's start someplace relatively small like I think if you're trying to break in a startup is a great place to go because you can learn about all the different positions available in Tech right and then because it's a startup they need bodies in positions and if you can do something well more than likely they'll allow you to do it so it's a really great opportunity to be able to break in and and figure out what you want to do but yeah getting the opportunity yeah that's an interesting perspective and I never thought about it that way but you're right yeah because I think about a startup and it's probably a flatter structure then you go into like some big Enterprise company and so there's probably a lot of opportunity for you to just like dive in and like take control of something yeah my I showed initiatives and do something at my previous company I had when I left I had the most titles of an employee because I jumped from so many different work like I just didn't know what I wanted to do and I think I had the opportunity to figure it out there and I was really blessed right and I'm very thankful for the team that was there at Compass yeah I didn't mention the names Compass real estate art real estate tech company out in New York but yeah so so what are the Caribbean developers conference yes we are do you are you a Caribbean native person yes yes well my father he's Guyanese and even though it is a part of South America we're considered a part of Caribbean because it's the only figure English it's the only English speaking country uh in South America and um and we're pretty close to Trinidad and so growing up yeah lived basically half my life going back and forth from Guyana to the States because my parents were separated yeah and um I got the opportunity to bounce around throughout the Caribbean and I love it here and the ultimate plan once I retire is to move to a Caribbean country and be able to sit on a beach somewhere yeah I feel that so much no idea I feel it so one thing I always like to ask Caribbean people do you do you think like your culture affects the way that you work particularly like with being a person in technology like does it change the way that you look at how applications are built or the things that you're interested in working that's a good question it's interesting question um I don't necessarily would say like technically it changes anything but I would say it does affect how I interact with others specifically like on like an international level because I feel like because I was exposed to different cultures and like Caribbean cultures there's an umbrella culture but then Within These individual countries there's a culture of their own right and being able to adapt your communication style um the way that you just move in different spaces I I feel like that's what I learned from my Caribbean background is my father is not from the state so he had to come and he had to operate and move in America the way Americans do and that can be very difficult for immigrants and it's a very calm and I feel like immigrant story and I feel like that is what really helps me as far as definitely moving in these type of spaces is adapting to what I'm around because how we speak especially as developer Advocates you're either speaking to ctOS you're speaking to leads we're speaking to Junior devs so you have to be able to kind of change and Alternate your your wording and stuff like that so definitely how I move in spaces is affected by my my background yeah I feel like we have to be chameleons yeah for sure yeah like you said like we we moved through this world this just not even just visiting countries but like doing business with different folks learning about different things and just having to interact with so many different types of people and types of Industries and types of projects like we have to be able to to be dynamic like that and be able to move around and not to say that other people aren't but I think for us specifically yeah we have to be very Dynamic from that because I feel like a lot of the things that are built and created again specifically talking about technology right a lot of that stuff doesn't originate where we come from yeah yeah like no one from the Caribbean to this day has like created a programming language or started you know a social network or a huge company yeah but we do use these things and we interact with these things and and you know for a lot of us that do work for these companies we have to be able to move back and forth right and but at the same time like maintain like our culture I think that's hugely important and I feel like in in the recent years it's gotten a lot better because people have the ability to be more themselves and I know like the the topic of like code switching and being able to become a little more like stiff I'd say when you're in these corporate settings um but nowadays I feel like it's becoming more accepted that I can go in as my authentic self and still be listened to and taken professionally and and be able to to cultivate a better culture wherever I'm going because it's a culture of acceptance and allowance yeah and one another thing I like to particularly about this conference too because a lot of folks would say hey you know what well the only thing they do in the Caribbean is party and hang out and like that real work doesn't happen in your room business doesn't happen here all these folks want to do is just go to the beach and chill out yeah you know what I mean but and I get it right I I get the stigma but also too like I take that to heart a little bit Yeah because as a person that I think I work pretty hard enough yeah I'm sure you feel the same way about what you do as well you know we take a lot of pride in the things that we do you know from a professional from a cultural perspective right and so from that like that's why I love to come to spaces like this so that we can highlight the things that we're all doing as a people together right like whether it's in business or technology or tourism or whatever the case is like we can all work together and we can do it our own way right again like we can be our eyes and so now it's not like we're not fitting into a mode yes of what someone else thinks or technology should look like or behave like you know what I mean we do it our own way and we're successful doing it and then now hopefully like you know because you know I have a child and I think about like my my son and any future children being able to say you know what like I can just do myself I can be myself right and and it's fun yeah and um we previously spoke about this but the fact of being able to form what your work day even looks like and not having that typical nine to five schedule and having to work like a dog and be on call late at night that's not something that Vibes for me personally but also it doesn't work for the majority of people so being able to really like carve out how we want to do tip is super important and I think it's only going to get bigger and bigger and I'm very like I'm super excited about like the next generation of graduates and and people coming into Tech because this normal normal nine to five schedule it's just it's no longer Gonna Fly and it's not playing now because most people are remote but it's just going to get even more and more flexible and I am super excited about it yeah no I agree with you I mean yeah again like thinking about like our cultures Caribbean people you know family is usually huge yes it's hugely important I think about growing up and the college days everything shuts down like everybody's with their family and everything shuts down your house probably has like 50 60 70 people in there you know what I mean and it doesn't matter like who's mad at who or who's upset or whatever the case is we're all just kind of like enjoying the moment that we have together and spending time in China because you know as families yeah I love that very well um tell me so you said that you're a bit rise yes like what are some of the things you do a bit right so I'm a developer Advocate at bitrize but considering how small the company is we do also still have some leeway about like what we do and what we can do so I'm involved with content creation so videos and and Tech writing and blogs and webinars and it's all that traditional like kind of Dev advocacy stuff but then I'm also working a lot with our customer experience team now and getting them more involved with what bitrise offers to their users because they're hearing it from our users yeah night and day about all the problems and all the issues and speaking with them and again I'm only a recent hire but speaking with them I asked well you're hearing all these questions and all these common issues people are having what are we doing to make it more of a instead of a one-to-one touch make it a one-to-many touch right and helping them now create content and working with them to kind of cultivate a more a holistic approach to customer service whereas instead of being able to just answer that question Point them to our documentation sure let them be self-helpers because at the end of the day the customers they're developers developers are notorious you know like we know how to read documentation we know how to go through things so um helping with that and then also just community community management is now something that I'm starting into which I'm just like learning learning yeah baby steps um but like that's what most of my career has been is baby steps into something that I like and then blossoming from there um so there's a ton of that but as of late it's just preparing for conferences doing my my decks and um and then talking to other folks around the way yeah I think I think one of the things I like about your story is you know I think you're a great example of like non-traditional um paths and just non-traditional I want to say like careers in technology yeah right like because everyone has like this template that you think oh a technology has to be this it's funny like I remember graduating college and you know walking on stage and they're like you know Cecil Phillip you know computer science department and everyone's like you're a computer science major like what do you think I was doing this whole time they're like we thought you were a business person like you don't look like a computer science person I'm like well what does a computer science person look like do you want me to be like scarfing pizza and mountains do all day like yeah you know what I mean I I like other things I like talking to people I like going to the gym I like sports that doesn't mean like I can't be successful in technology for sure you know and it also doesn't mean that I have to give up my culture to do it either right yeah so for me again like I I love to talk to people that just showed perspective I think perspective is very important for all of us yeah you know and just being able to understand like the differences of things yeah and I find it important that I that I share my story a lot because not just for the simple fact of people trying to to imitate what I did in order to break in and get in but also to show those hiring exits and those those c-suite people that diversity isn't just about like color gender whatever it's also about like identifying hey you have a customer service background you've done training and now you're in iOS development like it's a weird mix of things that I have and I was really I was I I was struggling to be quite honest to figure out taking my background taking all the things that I was really really good at and then applying it to a role or a position and I was just like I guess I'll just be an iOS Developer and this will be it but then I was lucky enough to find developer advocacy and be like oh it kind of plugs in all the little things and I was grateful that the manager that I spoke to here at bitrise he saw those little things that I have in all these different jobs that I've had in the past do apply to developer advocacy so I've I didn't I hadn't didn't write any blogs the minor blogs that I were doing were for Compass yeah and um the mini talks that I was doing for high school students looking to get into Tech so it wasn't like I was had a million and followers on Twitter it wasn't like I was really big in the tech world but they saw all the different things that I had in iPads and were able to apply it so I feel like that's what true diversity is all about is being able to pinpoint everybody's background and see like what are these little things that you can do that we can apply to your work to this role and being flexible um so far so it's not just like checking boxes on a job description it's it's more organic I feel like and more and more and it's better I feel like for the company for the people involved for the teams because it's it's something that people are passionate about because these are skills that they just honestly have in them it's not something that they learned it's just something that you you just enjoy and you can do yeah yeah yeah so yeah that's fine I think um I know developer advocacy is a very Community focused job right like so there's obviously like there's a technical you know aptitude part of it sure but then there's also the community part of it right and I think being a big part of a community like the authenticity is important right so kind of like what you're talking about like when you have the passion and you actually have like again Insider view you actually care about doing things for people they're not it's not about okrs or Sprints and timelines and those types of things yeah it's about okay well this is what this group of people needs for me you know what I mean what can I do to empower them to make good decisions to give them advice to kind of lead them down a path that I think would help them be successful right and I think that's kind of the position that we have to hold as developer Advocates right like sure like we work for company in the company business to do stuff but also too you know we we have a responsibility for our community absolutely to go do so yes I always every time I I speak nowadays I I try not to use spit rise is anything in my in my presentations because to me bitrise is great for certain groups certain companies certain organizations and it's great if a junior Dev or a single Dev try to make their app is using it but I understand that it's not for everybody it's it's a it's a very robust system and it has a lot of great benefits but for some it just doesn't work so I could care less if you end up using a different platform yes but um but the idea of what mobile devops and CI CD pipeline that's what I want to translate to everybody and make sure that they understand okay yeah and so I know obviously you work a lot with the community like what are some of the other community programs that you're working with right now like with some of the things you're involved in yeah so before the pandemi I was working with a small group who was going into New York City uh New York star state prisons and working with incarcerated individuals to help learn code to gain those skills for when they do get released they're able to enter the job market primarily with tech there aren't a ton of background checks usually and people are a little bit more flexible in who and what they can hire obviously maybe not like Financial tech companies but there are there's so many different options out there and even so like if they have entrepreneurial skills they can do their own thing and be self-started um so that was something that I was involved in but due to the pandemic a lot of that got shut down so there is now more of a push for um for private prisons and for state prisons to allow these programs back in so um unfortunately the program that I was with has now is no longer available like they're not there so I'm now going back into trying to figure out where I can place myself and primarily looking for women who are incarcerated I feel like people who are in the incarceration system the prison system they're often forgot about and they're kind of like oh it's a lost cause yeah and I feel like a lot of tech now is focused on children which is great don't get me wrong but there is a whole community of people who have all these great skills like not for nothing if you're a drug dealer you're an entrepreneur like you're you're it's your business person an unfortunate situation but it's you're a business person so if you can apply those skills to Tech something else to something else then you can be prosperous and I'm hoping that now that the pandemic has really eased up and things are changing to be able to get back into to working and doing that type of stuff yeah that's amazing and it sounds like a great program for a lot of folks to get involved in yeah if for folks that are watching if you want to if they wanted to I don't know maybe reach out to you or yeah get involved in doing stuff like that like do you have any I don't know links that you could share or like how can folks get involved in what you do I should have prepared um best thing to do is just email me um l-e-i-l-a-h-sw at gmail um yeah and you do like LinkedIn Twitter yeah I have all that stuff but I'm not very I'm a bad developer Advocate I'm trying to be more active on social media um specifically Finn it's Lila Simone my Twitter is underscore Lila Simone my Instagram is Lila Simone so you find me Leela Simone awesome wait thank you so much man I really appreciate it this is great and thank you all for watching again we're here at the Caribbean developers conference and we just spoke to Lilo and so if you're interested sit in getting involved in like any of the different programs she spoke about make sure you reach out to her on social media preferably by email yeah she'll help you get in contact with some great programs that you can get involved with great thank you all so much thanks

Cecil Phillip I'm a developer advocate of stripe and we're here at the Caribbean developer conference we're talking to tons of different companies and different different folks just trying to learn about what they're doing down here while we're at the conference and so I have my friend here Alex and so Alex why don't you introduce yourself to folks tell them who you are and a little bit about what you do yeah sounds good so Alex mail Branch I work for GitHub right now as the global engagement lead for the GitHub for startups program so we're helping Founders and startups across the world engage in what they're doing from a technological standpoint and and grow uh grow their company leverage in GitHub so what made you want to work with Founders is that is there something that's familiar space for you yeah so actually I I just before I join GitHub I was a Founder myself okay yeah so I I started tech company and did that for a few years and just really enjoyed uh the strategy of it the grind of it uh you know just getting to innovate and meet different people um you know I traveled a whole bunch doing pitch decks and things like that and so being an underrepresented founder myself you know going through that process I realized okay there's a lot that that we could use as underrepresented Founders and Founders in general and I want to be a part of that growth um from a larger scale so I think it was perfect for me as I was transitioning out of being a full-time founder how can I continue to leverage working with Founders and helping and GitHub had a great opportunity for me what are some of the things you wish you knew going into like starting your company that no one told you before like what are like the founder tips and tricks what do you think folks need to know about um I think something that people say a lot but it's kind of one of those things where like you don't know until you experience it yourself yeah it's building that Community around you when you're starting so a lot of people at least from the outside they start with like your co-founders right and that's your community how you're gonna build but it's a lot more than that right I had like investors um that gave you know a ten thousand dollar check but they were really there as mentors for me to help kind of go through the ins and outs of how to pitch and what kind of investors are good investors and um so building that sort of community building a Founder Community like you know we're going through very unique stressful situations yeah other Founders and kind of know what that's like so having someone to call and be like hey like I'm I'm at a brain you know block right now like how did you get through this or maybe you just want to talk about something else so I think building that Community as a as a Founder is really really important I think that's also a way that I'm I'm trying to involve GitHub and trying to leverage that to help build an ecosystem of other Founders yeah because when I think about it like you can have whatever product that you're building right whatever product You're Building whatever service you're creating and it could be like the best products in the world but without that Network in that Community sure then it kind of puts you at a disadvantage right because now you know how do you get your message out there like exactly how do people know about what you're doing how do you get the support that you need yes the mentorship you need the funding you need exactly how do I reach out into that larger founder Community to really you know get like that next level of success and engagement yeah that I need outside of like the quality of my actual product right and to your point you started with uh oh man I'm sorry I just lost it uh you started with oh you started with having different Industries and like different products that you're building and even though you I might be working on kind of a medical device startup you might be working on a retail startup obviously they're very different but there's cores there's a core to building a startup that is the same sure and so having those different people in different Industries they're struggling with very similar problems in the building of your startup but they can come from a different perspective because their industry might work differently yeah so another good reason why it's really important to have that different uh that ecosystem for you so you there's something about you I'm trying to put my finger on it where are you from like like what is your background like like yeah what is your so because I'm asking too because I always find like for different folks in different cultures like there's always an energy sure behind of it like it's a motivation there's something I have to prove yeah or there's something that's just kind of in my family DNA yeah that's just how we are so I'd love to know a little bit about your background and like how did you get to the space yeah so my family is from Haiti okay yeah so my mom immigrated from Haiti to New York when she was 17. okay and then um you know I'm one of four kids and my mom's a single mom and that's how I grew up for the most part so when we when she came to America she settled in a couple different places eventually I was I grew up in Chicago okay and so just kind of kind of seeing her go through you know she worked two three jobs when I was in Middle School in high school just kind of seeing what that was like for her she's yeah would sleep in her car in between shifts and and so just kind of seeing what that level of work ethic looks like of course I wanted to be able to take that and put it into something that was going to be you know secure for my family right like to see my mom worth two and three jobs is like something I don't want to see ever again and I definitely don't want to experience I get it but the working the work ethic that she had is you know second to none so yeah I just I think just seeing that you know I started working when I was 14 and working a couple jobs in high school as well and it's just one of those things I I always want to continue to grow and build and do and I think it just kind of aligns with what a Founder needs to be able to do in order to be successful at least somewhat right yeah I I always find like like it takes a certain type of person to be like I'm gonna do this myself yeah you know what I mean there's folks that are like you know what I'm comfortable working for a company and having them deal with everything yeah yeah but then there's a there's something else inside of a person that drives them to be like hey I want to put on the entrepreneurial hat like I want to take on the responsibility yeah because again it's more than just building the products but it's also taking care of your employees it's also again making sure that we have enough you know payroll to go around yeah tons of other things that kind of like go into that and so now sure you might be a great great engineer or you know a great artist or whatever the case is but then now being a Founder is so much more than that responsibility plus the responsibility sure right so I can completely understand where like hey given your backgrounds why you could be like you know what like I'm willing to put in the work yeah because I've seen what it's like when you don't really have control and I find like profounders they're like you know what I get it I want to have control over my space or whatever right does that make sense yeah it does and the interesting thing that aligns with that is I started my company when I was on paternity leave with my second daughter wow so I was one of those times where you know I was on paternally from my tech company I was working at um you know I was pulling the midnight Duty or whatever else to help um with feeding and that sort of thing and it was in those moments where I was like you know what like I'm looking at I have one already she's two at the time have this new one I'm like this I need to make I gotta figure this out yeah I need to I need to do something right because now I'm looking at our I am living that thing I was looking at as being the parent now like I'm looking at my daughter I'm like all right like this is my time to see what I can do to make that difference that I'd always said hey I want to do that and so that's actually when it started and um so yeah it makes complete sense as far as like that was the time I was like all right it's time for me to go out take some control see what I can do right and and if it doesn't go well right it's huge learnings right huge learnings from just starting and even failing a startup like so many things that you can take on to your next roles your next companies and maybe even try again most entrepreneurs are successful in their second third fourth attempt yeah so and that's why because the the experience is so valuable you know I could see why this is such a perfect world for you to get up for startups yeah because again because of your background because of your history as being a Founder you know if if I was a Founder right I want to start Cecil's new company like today all right and I wanted to join GitHub for startups like what do I do and then what am I going to get out of being a part of this program yeah great question so GitHub for startups.com you apply so we've got we've got an offering for companies that come through a partner of ours okay so like a VC partner an accelerator things of that nature and then we have another offering for people that don't come through that so we want to make sure it's inclusive and what you get is a free seats a number of free seats for GitHub Enterprise okay um and the the difference in between the offerings is basically how long you get it in some of the extra kind of uh product release features and so you'll go on and apply what I usually tell people even if they're not currently like a startup with a partner of ours and say hey if you're being funded by someone even a singular investor have them fill out our our partner application once they do that you'll go through they'll go through an onboarding very quick yeah and then now you'll go through as a partner and the reason why is with as a partner signed startup yes you'll get the three seats so it's 20 free GitHub seats for Enterprise GitHub Enterprise for a year and then 50 in the next year but as a partner of ours you'll also get possible access to like early product releases so okay um we we have a strong partnership with Y combinator and so some of the companies that were in y combinator got Early Access to co-pilot and code spaces which are some of our hot new services that have just come out and so you'll be able to get some early access to that but also events that we throw for our com our founding or uh the founders in our company so whether it be funding events whether it be kind of uh as a building that founder ecosystem so happy hours and things of that nature we do things all throughout the year and so you'll get that kind of extra support from from us as well and then we do educational stuff throughout the year so you know it could be things that are strictly for GitHub so you know how to build X Y and Z on GitHub how to do custom actions on GitHub things of that nature or it could just be hey we brought in these people from Andresen to talk about how to raise right well like what are the things that they're looking for what's a good pitch deck right so again we're just we're trying to build in addition to the free credits that we can give build using the ecosystem that we have as GitHub yeah to help these companies leverage those so in addition to like those benefits we saw it amazing right because I know like code spaces and actions and all that type of stuff it sounds like it's like some of the most cutting-edge things that are happening right now but in addition to that um do I get any type of mentorship or yeah good question so there it's a brand new program we actually just launched it in September oh so this is fresh yeah very fresh like two months ago September exactly brand brand new so there was there was like an incubation period when I came on so I just started GitHub about six months ago and they brought us on say hey like we're coming up with this program like let's have like an incubation period and then we'll launch it right and so some of the things that we're doing today are not going to be the things that we do six months from now sure and so I say that to say like some of the things that we're kind of talking through around like mentorships for engineering or like technical co-founders because of course that's that's the root of GitHub right as developers so building an ecosystem or extra features or Community around Engineers um in developers in that way uh mentorship with some of our like customer Advisory board for actual GitHub so we're doing we've got our yearly conference Universe next week and some of our customer customer Advisory board members from you know the American Airlines and stripe and some of the biggest companies in the world right we have Executives that are set on the board we're working on possibly doing mentorship with some Founders and our cab members fantastic yeah so a lot of really great opportunities that we're looking to get kind of uh into in 2023 and so at the moment right as we're building that ecosystem and helping leverage uh you know the relationships and the technology we have but next year we're hoping to launch a lot more things that are going to bring that to the next level okay so then you so you told me what I need to do to register as a company as a new founder are there any particular requirements like do I have to be uh in a particular region yeah yes so English speaking Spanish speaking folks like so we're Global yeah Global program uh the only thing the only requirement is that you're new to GitHub Enterprise which most if not all startups are yeah uh because of cost right and then they're before or excuse me they have not gotten their series a round of funding okay yeah so as long as you've you lessen your series a round of funding um you're you're welcome to join in and get that free information or excuse me that free technology and and be a part of the program cool that's awesome yeah yeah so so we're here at the Caribbean developers conference yes like what are some of the things that you're hoping to get from you know GitHub for startups being here for me number one especially as someone that's from this region there's a lot of talent here and I don't think that Talent has the voice that it really needs sure I think people think of like offshore Talent oh you know Fiverr upwork I can have them do one or two things and move on there's a lot of innovators here right and so what I hope to get out of this is meet some of those innovators whether they're starting their own companies now or they just have that kind of uh you know thought processing and they're trying to figure out what they want to do I want to start to give those people an opportunity to meet the right people right whether it be from a funding perspective if they already have a company or just from a mentorship or person-to-person perspective so I'm hoping to to start those relationships and start to leverage those I'm also hoping to learn from the people around me right and you know I'm from Haiti but I'm I've lived in America my whole life yeah so there are a lot of perspectives that the this culture this region that are in the same industry as me in Tech and in Nevada development right they've got a different view of how they use GitHub or how they use different tools what they're using it for and so I hope to learn that right just kind of soak that in as I'm here and and love the energy from the people in the area right and so how can you how can I be in this space and continue to take their unique perspective of how they use technology and and bring that back to how we how we use technology yeah and I think that's a great point because I feel like for a lot of folks that are from from the Caribbean I'm just from developing economies in general yeah you know a lot of folks that have the privilege to leave like you know we leave we go to college we you know become educated but then now it's like oh wow if I go home what am I going to do right like you might have gone and learned something that they might not be an industry for you in your particular country right so no you know what you don't you know come home now but then now they've been this this knowledge and this experience still it would be great for people to come home absolutely and just share that information with folks let them know hey well this is possible and this is what you can do absolutely because I think a big part of it is just perspective right I think about when I first started and I thought hey I want to be a computer person but computer people in my country in Antigo well they plugged in printers and yeah yeah you know move boxes around I thought that's what computer people did yeah until I left and I got perspective and I'm like oh you know what I could be a software developer I could be a designer yeah there's programming managers I could be a director of a company yeah I could go work for any company I want and I could work from home absolutely I didn't have perspective yeah you know what I mean so again I think it's great for us to come back and give perspective ensure knowledge with people kids with founders with all these different folks just so they can know what's possible in my opinion that's actually like the most important thing yeah like uh you know when I started the founder process and people would ask me did you become a Founder to like be you know the next Jeff Bezos or whatever and yeah money has never really been a motivating factor for me other than to secure like you know happiness for my family but you can you can do that with a relatively you know low number you don't need to be Jeff Bezos yeah but for me it was like I can get to a point where I have the resources and uh the gravity to go back to Haiti to go to these places and say hey like this is this is real like we can do this like this is this is a platform that I can I'm blessed to be able to come to a place like this speak on stage yeah and be able to say to people that are in my region like hey like I am I am I was here like I I didn't really have the same perspective and now I get to talk on stage and spread that knowledge and hopefully kind of build those relationships and come back and and grow and so as I hopefully become more successful in my career and get that gravity to come back and put that back into Haiti and yeah in other countries and in places that need it that's that's what's most exciting for me awesome man well hey Alex I really appreciate you coming over and talking to us no it was awesome thank you for having me and thank all of you for watching again so we're here at the criminal development conference talking to different Founders and we just spoke to Alex from GitHub for startups make sure you head over to GitHub for startups.com and register your company and see what all they have to offer [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'VTZSjO9jPaw', 'title': 'Getting started with GitHub for Startups',

Document(page_content=\"hey what's up welcome back in this episode you're going to learn how to accept a one-time payment using a custom form with the payment element if you're looking for a simpler integration path we have the no code payment links option where you can set up a payment link directly through the dashboard and then share that with your customers through social media email text message Etc alternatively there's another option called stripe checkout this is a a very simple integration that has one API call on the server you redirect your customer to a stripe hosted page but in today's episode we're going to talk about integrating the payment element this allows you to build your own custom hosted form and collect lots of different payment method types so the payment element supports anything from cards all the way to bank accounts you've got support for wallets like Google pay and Apple pay all the way to buy now pay later like a firm and after pay clear pay so it is a great option for building your own custom form to accept a one-time payment so just as a quick roadmap for today we're going to install sample then we're going to go through the dashboard and talk about how you can enable payment methods these are going to be those payment methods that are dynamically rendered into the payment element every time the page loads and then we're going to create a payment intent on the server and use its client secret to render the payment element on the client so that we can collect payment details from the customer it will ultimately submit that payment to stripe and then we're going to handle any of those post-processing events we're going to talk about web Hooks and a few other considerations that you might want to think about as you're building out your integration so let's get into it foreign we're going to start from a stripe sample today so that we don't have to write a bunch of boilerplate for today's demo if you haven't already you can head over to the extension gallery and install the striper vs code extension one of the handy Tools in here is to start with a stripe sample so here we're going to click on start with a sample and start with the starter sample and we're going to use the main integration today HTML on the client Java spark on the server and we're going to call this starter Java that's going to download and clone a sample locally it'll also use the stripe for vs code extension to set our API keys in an environment variable so this is all ready for us to go all right let's take a look so in the server directory you'll notice there is this Dot N file at the root of the server directory this already has our API Keys set that's because the strip for vs code extension is using the stripe CLI under the hood and we have already authenticated with the stripe CLI now if you don't have API Keys set here you'll want to make sure that there is a DOT end file in the root of your server directory we also have a client directory here that's going to have our HTML and JavaScript for now we just have this very simple JavaScript page now if we want to start up the server there are instructions in the readme at the very bottom for how to fire this up we're going to build the package with Maven package so we can open up the terminal here CD into the server and say Maven package and that's going to install our dependencies and build the jar file that we're going to use to run our servers and then we can say fire up the server with this command and now we are running on localhost 4242. okay so let's jump into the server directory and take a look at what we've got going on here so there is a simple server.java file and in here there's going to be a couple different things that we want to take a look at all right we'll start off at the very top of the server class now this create payment request class and the create payment response class are two helpers that we're not going to use today there's also this config response and failure response classes these are all helpful classes for serializing and deserializing Json as we head down into the main function you'll notice that we have a couple of routes already defined there's one called slash config this is for fetching our publishable API key it is a best practice to fetch your publishable key from the server instead of hard coding on the client just in case you need to roll that key for any reason especially if you're using mobile clients where the mobile client might be you know installed one time and not updated for years if you have to roll your publishable key you don't want that to impact your end users now we've also got a create payment intent endpoint as part of the sample we're actually just going to remove that entire endpoint here because we're going to re-implement that as part of today's demo you also see a web hook Handler this is a route for processing and handling web hook events and we're going to use this and I'll talk about how to test your web hook endpoint in order to process the payment intent succeeded event for fulfillment and we'll do that a little bit later all right so this is the skeleton that we're going to start with our page is up and running we've got our server up and running so let's talk about how we might enable some payment methods so that we can dynamically render those in the payment element on our custom form now from the stripe dashboard we can head over to the settings and to the payment method settings this is where we can manage our payment methods and enable or disable different ways that customers can pay through our payment element so you'll see here that we have cards enabled link Apple pay Google pay several different wallet methods there's lots of different bank redirects these are popular across Europe we also have some buy now pay later payment methods that are enabled finally we even have ACH direct debit as one of the payment methods that customers could use now if we wanted to enable Canadian pre-authorized debits we could click turn on and this would enable us to use Canadian pre-authorized debits as a payment method type inside of our payment flows so this is where we manage our payment methods and these are the payment methods that will be dynamically derived inside of our payment element when we render that and show it to customers so that's how you enable and manage your payment methods instead of needing to deploy any new code you can just come into the dashboard and enable or disable different payment method types here's an overview of the payment flow we're going to implement today when a customer lands on our page we're going to make an Ajax request from the client back to our server maybe that will include any in order information or a product that they want to purchase and then from our server we're going to calculate the amount that we want to charge and make an API call to stripe to create a payment intent when stripe Returns the payment intent object from the API we're going to pull off the client secret property from that payment intent and hand that off to our client so that we can render the payment element on the front end so let's go over to the server and implement this step here where we're going to create the payment intent so here on the server we're going to make a post route for create payment intent this is going to take in the request and the response we're going to respond with Json so I'm going to say response.type is application Json next we need to actually make the API call to create our payment intent here so we're going to say payment intent create params is going to be built with a a builder here from this payment intent create params Builder and we say dot Builder and ultimately dot build and we need to set a couple different values here so we're going to set the amount and this is going to take in a long in our case we're going to just charge 1099. now if you wanted to again you could pass in some arguments from the client maybe the ID of the product and then you can look up the product in the database to derive the amount that you want to actually charge so we're going to pass that in as the the hard-coded amount that we're going to charge today we also want to set the currency so in this case we're going to set it to USD and finally we want to configure the payment intent so that when we use its client secret on the front end it will derive the payment method types that are available so whether it's cards or bank accounts based on the configuration that we have in the stripe dashboard that way we don't have to deploy new code to enable or disable different payment method types the way we do that is by saying sent automatic payment methods and we're going to pass in another argument here that's going to enable those payment methods so we're going to say payment intent uh create params.automatic payment methods dot Builder dot build and in this case we're going to call set enabled to true that's going to enable our automatic payment methods so at this point we've constructed some params that we then want to send to the stripe API the way we do that is by calling the payment intent.create method and passing in those params that's going to give us back a payment intent object that we can store off here in an intent variable and we want to again pull off the client secret property from this intent and render that back as Json so I'm going to say return gson.2 Json and we're going to pass in some like client secret response object that we will build here in a second just using a simple hash map this is going to be a hash map from string to string and we're going to call it that client Secret response and it'll just be a simple new hash map now the one key we want to set on this is based on the intense client secret so we're going to say client secret response.put client secret like that Camel case and then we're going to pull off the intent client get client Secret and we should be good to go all right so we need to restart our server so we're going to go back into the server directory and I'm going to combine our packaging and our starting of the server into one command and hit enter and now what we should be able to do is create another terminal here and say curl Dash X post to localhost 4242 create payment intent this is going to send a post request and fire off this endpoint and we get back our client secret our Json that has the client secret property embedded in it so at this point we're done creating the payment intent on the server now there's a bunch of different arguments that you could pass in when you're configuring the params for that API call so head over to the API reference and take a look at the docs about all the different ways that you can configure this for your use case all right now that we have our client secret property let's jump over to the front end and add a form to our page so that we can collect payment so right now on our index.html page we have a script tag that is loading stripe.js from js.stripe.com we've also got just a little bit of HTML here so we're going to change this to accept a payment and we're going to add a form here and it doesn't need an action because we're going to handle submission of this form client size we're going to call this our payment form and inside of our payment form we're gonna have a couple divs and a button so the first div is going to be our payment element and our second div is going to be our error messages finally we're going to have a button that will just say pay now the first div here for the payment element this is where we're going to mount the element into so we're going to use JavaScript on the front end fetch that client secret property from the server and then we're going to mount that into this div here so let's create a new Javascript file here we're going to call it payment.js and we're going to load that on our index page here we're going to say just dot slash payment and now we'll Implement our payment.js file so when the page is fully loaded we want to do a couple things first we're going to fetch the publishable key from the server then we're going to fetch the client secret property for the payment intent and then we'll Mount our elements okay so to fetch our publishable key from the server we're going to use the fetch API to make a get request to slash config now this method is going to return a promise that will resolve with a response object that has a method on it called Json which will also return a promise so we're going to await that and this is going to give us back our publishable key we're going to use that publishable key to initialize a new instance of stripe and that will allow us to construct some elements and use the stripe API client side from here forward now we want to fetch the client secret property for that payment intent so we're going to make the call a fetch call to create payment intent and this is going to take in an object because we need to specify the method as post request we're also going to pass in some headers saying that we want back a content type of application Json and here's where you would specify any body if you wanted to pass in some some arguments from the client maybe including like a product ID or something that you're going to use in order to derive which amount you want to charge in the demo today we're not actually passing anything from the front end and we're just hard coding that 1099 amount this fetch method is going to return a promise it's going to resolve with an object again a response object that has this Json property on it so we're going to await this again and this time we're going to pull off the client secret property now we're going to use this client secret to construct our elements so we say const elements is strive.elements now in the past you would just call stripe.elements and that would give you back an elements group that could create you know one of the classic card elements but in the case of the payment element we want to construct our elements group passing in the client secret property from the payment intent we just created server side this will allow us to derive which payment method types we should display based on the currency of the payment intent and the payment method types that are enabled in the stripe dashboard all right let's make a payment element we're going to call elements.create and pass in the string payment that's going to create a payment element for us and now we can finally Mount the payment element onto our form by passing in the CSS selector for that div that we created earlier so at this point if we were to refresh our page here we should see our pay button we also see the payment element rendered out so that's great now we're able to sort of collect payment details on the client but if we were to push the pay button here this is not actually going to submit the payment to stripe that is going to be in the next step here next we're going to grab reference to our form element using document.getelementbyid passing in the ID of the payment form now when the form is submitted we're going to first prevent the default on the event so that it does not cause a full page refresh then we're going to submit the payment to stripe so on stripe.js on this stripe object we can call confirm payment and we can pass in this object that has reference to the elements group that we created earlier and it also has some arguments here that are going to configure what happens when we confirm payments so we're going to pass in some confirmed params inside of confirm params we want to include a return URL and this is where the customer will be redirected after they complete the payment flow this is going to be window.location.8 for the demo today we're going to keep it really simple we're going to redirect to another HTML page that's called complete.html so we're going to say window.location.href that's we'll split on the question mark and then just grab the first part of that and add on the complete.html as our route now confirm payment might return a promise in the case that payment failed and that'll have an error property on it so we can check to see if there was an error and if there was then we want to log that out in our messages div that we created earlier so again we're going to grab reference to the messages div with document.getelement by ID and we're going to pass in error messages and we're going to populate those messages with the error response objects we're going to say error.message all right now we're ready to take this for a spin we're going to refresh our page so that we have that new JavaScript and we're ready to walk through the flow you also notice that these different payment method types are rendering based on the currency and also the settings that I have enabled in the stripe dashboard so here we can pass in a test card number this is the 4242 number which will result in a successful payment we can click on pay and were redirected to a new page at the top here if you zoom in you can see that this is going to the complete.html route But it includes a couple things in the query string parameter namely it has a payment intent id and a payment intent client secret okay so let's go implement complete.html so let's create a new HTML file here we're going to call it complete.html we're going to put this inside of the client and I'm actually just going to grab most of what we already had in index.html to get us started so instead of payment.js we're going to create another file called complete.js and we're going to have just a completion page here uh clean this up a little bit and now we'll also add a pre-tag here that's going to have the ID of payment intent and that'll give us a place to render out the Json for the payment intent so we can look at its status and all the attributes that we might use to build our own custom sort of like confirmation page all right let's make a new file for that complete.js and again once the document is fully loaded we're going to fetch the publishable key and then we're going to render the payment intent okay so let's grab our client our publishable key and construct an instance of the stripe object we also want to grab that client secret property off the query string parameter so we're going to create a new params object here from URL search params passing in window.location.href and now we can call params.get and pass in payment intent client secret all lower case snake case and now we can use stripe.js client side to re-retrieve the payment intent so stripe dot retrieve payment intent takes in a client secret property this again returns a promise that once it resolves it'll have this payment intent property on it and that payment intent will have all of the Json for the object so again we're going to render this out into the the page we can say document dot get element by ID payment intent dot enter text is going to be equal to well stringify our payment intent and null two just to make it look nice so if we refresh our page here now we see this complete.html page and we're seeing the contents of our payment intent we can see the status is succeeded here at the bottom so we know that our payment has successfully gone through we can also tell a bunch of information about the payment intent including what payment method types might have been presented and any other details we don't want to use this completion page as the signal for when we should complete our fulfillment of the order instead we want to use web hooks so web hooks are a way to be notified from stripe when events happen on your stripe account the benefit of web hooks over using this completion page is if someone closes their browser or maybe their internet dies or their battery dies on their phone there's a possibility that they won't be redirected to this completion page although they may have completed payment and in that case we still want to make sure that we're fulfilling the order with a web hook Handler stripe will continue retrying to deliver a webhook event notification for up to three days with exponential back off if the first delivery is not successful so we know that a webhook endpoint is much more reliable because there are built-in retries so if we look at our webhook endpoint here you'll notice that we are parsing the incoming request body from stripe or constructing an event and then we're going to look at the event type and based on the type of the event we can create this switch statement where depending on the event type we can perform different actions fulfill orders pull from inventory print shipping labels Etc right now we're just printing out that we received payment here this is going to be printed out to the server logs now I wanted to show that there's this tool inside of the striper vs code extension where we can forward events to a local running server so we're going to say we want to forward events to localhost 4242 webhook now this dialog here is going to ask us for two different URLs the first is for account events those are events that are firing on our own account we haven't talked about stripe connect at all that's a tool for building Platforms in marketplaces but this second web hook endpoint that it's expecting is for connect events so we're going to fire this up and this will start a new listener on our stripe account and as events fire they're going to be logged out here to our stripe listener they're also going to be forwarded into our server so we're going to take a look at this listen output as we reload the page because recall that as soon as we reload our root route that's going to make an API call to stripe to create a payment intent and here we can see that the paymentintent.created event fired it was delivered to our web hook Handler and the server responded with a 400 status code that's because we're not currently handling that event type that's an unexpected event type okay so now if we go through our payment flow one more time we can see that we received this payment intent succeeded event and responded with a 200 status code from our server if we go over to the server logs we can see that this payment intent received or this payment received output message was indeed logged to the console again this is where you would handle fulfillment of those payments you might be wondering how to test out your integration well over in the documentation for accepting a payment you can drill down into the test integration section and for each of the different payment method families between cards wallets Bank redirects Etc there are several different things that will allow you to test different scenarios so for instance we can grab this card this test card that ends in 3155 and we can use that as one of our test cards inside of the payment element and you'll notice that as we go through the payment flow here this will trigger a secure customer authentication payment flow so this is going to pop up a modal and in production this modal would contain a bank account 2fa or sort of like a one-time code or some way to verify that the customer is who they say they are and that they are allowed to authenticate this payment so that's one way that you can test sort of 3D secure and secure customer authentication is with that special card number another thing worth noting is in the documentation there are some optional steps depending on specific payment method types or QR code based payment methods these might require that you pass additional details when creating the payment intent or they might have other considerations like with Apple pay you'll need to go into the dashboard and make sure that you have an Apple pay domain set up and verified so just to review the entire flow the customer lands on the page and we use any information from that page to create a payment intent using the API and then when we return that payment intents client secret to the client we use that to build out a payment element on our custom form that's where customers enter their billing details and then we can submit that payment directly to stripe client side and then the customer is redirected to a return URL where we display this return status or this success status completion status and finally we're handling fulfillment with our web hook that's where we're actually pulling from inventory and printing shipping labels and doing all those things that we might do when someone buys something from us thank you so much for watching and we'll see in the next one foreign [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'zyM5OsXUGdI', 'title': 'Accept a payment with the Payment Element using Java', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count':

to stripe Dev live this is a show about interesting topics presented by interesting people this is part three of our uh so far like the three parts series of struggles of a developer Advocate now if you missed the previous two shows don't worry they are up on YouTube so you can listen to those later or I can just give you a real recap right now it's basically just five developer Advocates screaming into the abyss uh my name is Paul I am a developer Advocate at stripe and speaking of screaming into the abyss I have some other wonderful developer Advocates with me on the panel today so let's start with a quick round of introductions before we jump into our discussion let's start with Brian tell us who are you and what are you doing here nobody come on I'm Brian Clark I'm a developer Advocate at sneak uh I've been in the industry for 10 plus years I would say now and uh yeah happy to talk about my experience as a developer Advocate I've only been a developer advocate for a little over five years now prior to that I was in engineering roles is that all only five years yeah yeah yeah uh welcome Brian okay uh Roselle tell us about yourself hey I'm Roselle and I'm a junior developer Advocate at GitHub uh I've been a developer advocate for a little over a year and before that I was a software engineer and how long were you a software engineer for because apparently we're doing this now oh I'm James James you want to tell us about yourself what's up I thought you had a perfect opportunity to transition me in first not that I'm jealous about going last but you said introduce everyone quickly and I was like oh it's got to be in there oh I didn't even realize that I'm so embarrassed oh okay cool dang um yeah no worries so I am a content creator which uh has a lot of overlap with developer advocacy uh but I do that full-time as of the summer so as of July which is uh pretty cool and I've got several years of experience in technical evangelism and developer experience or a developer advocacy as well so similar to our other amazing guests and Roselle and Brian let's back up let's clarify because I don't think the audio must not have come through clearly I was trying to say even if it didn't come out amazing guests in Brian Anderson ah okay okay thank you yes yes better better better yes all right so let's jump in because we lost a bit of time because of that technical difficulties so the first thing that I want to kind of talk about is the importance of technical depth in developer advocacy so I think there is this what I'm talking about statistical it comes to technical depth is that we often turn to developer Advocates to uh create content about uh uh different topics and Concepts that they might not be an expert in themselves and is that okay should we or should developer Advocates really only talk about the things that they are the bona fide expert in is like how how really important is it to have that technical definite topic I'll go um I think so at first I thought you had to be super technical to be a developer Advocate or to be in devrel in general and as I've like continued this role I learned that that's not true I think there's value in you being able to understand code and technology in general but it's also really valuable to be sharing your journey of like oh I'm learning to use this product um and here's my perspective on it because a lot of times people will write um or create content whatever like educational content around something with a lot of assumptions in place like oh they you're assuming your audience knows this this and this but we do need to also cater for people who are newer to that technology or tool yeah I mean how do you get that I think the uh part of the question that kind of getting at here is that there's definitely a an element of like almost compostra syndrome where you're asking me to talk about or write content for this particular topic that's I'm not the expert how do I know I don't know what I'm doing and there's always like that that feeling of um why should people believe me when I'm not like the the foremost expert in this kind of stuff so it can be a little bit difficult as a developer Advocates to kind of like pretend that you're not someone that you're not as it were or maybe that's just me how do you guys feel about that rats all right let's play Invisible rock paper scissors Brian hey uh what beats over scissors I win all right it's getting weird so uh yeah I think a couple of things that are super relevant there are uh and I'll give an example of like me starting my career so I graduated college and started as a technical evangelist at Microsoft which means at the age of like 22 I was giving talks and presentations to rooms full of developers at times that have been writing code longer than I have been alive and that was really intimidating especially at first but the thing became that or was that those people that have been writing code for so long hadn't necessarily done the thing that I was teaching them so I was teaching them how to build modern Windows 8 and eventually Windows 10 applications something that they hadn't done they had built older forms of Windows applications but I hadn't done that so even though I wasn't an expert in that topic I knew something newer that they had not yet known or been um been exposed to which means I was able to still provide value and I think we also have to be like really careful about the like throwing around the word expert because I would not consider myself an expert in anything that's a like very impactful word to lead for someone so the idea of like the hesitation of not being able to create content or give talks or whatever without being an expert there would be no talks across the world if uh if we only allowed experts to talk so yeah I think it all depends on your audience and I think you have to tailor your presentation and what you're talking about too to the audience in addition to specifically their experience their knowledge base their experience with the topic that you're talking about and just overall knowledge and I think we'll get more into like some of the overall Tech experience that is super useful which enables you to talk to more audiences but there are plenty of audience and opportunities to talk to while being far far from an expert and a topic bro you want to add something to that no uh I completely agree with what James said what Roselle said I think um my biggest thing in terms of like people potentially feeling imposter syndrome which I think you get that whether you're in devrel or you're an engineer or any other roles within the space as well um in terms of getting into what was I going to say in blanket now sorry I'm kind of multitasking in terms of getting into a position like this I I don't I don't think you'd have to be technical or have a technical background uh to to be a developer Advocate and plus who am I to say whether you can or cannot but I do think having some experience in development whether it's on the side or you know you learned on your own or you do you worked in a position professionally is beneficial in this role because it makes it a bit you're able to relate more to the developers perspective when you're creating content or trying to convey a message to a developer audience right so um I don't think it's required but I think it's beneficial in that regard I'll have one additional thing on the flip side of that is the the benefit of having that techniques that deeper technical experience and and where some of the Imposter syndrome is totally valid is a lot of tech communities depending on which one and who specifically is there as you're giving a talk they are looking to challenge you that's one of the things that is is hard to respond to especially when people ask you questions that you don't know and it's hard to have the confidence to admit that you don't know in front of a room full of people so like the reality of some of this is like yes you can totally do devro with less experience you can totally give talks to different audiences and tailor it to your audience especially but there is a high potential of having one of those or multiple in the audience who just want to challenge you to see you struggle during a conversation so if you have the technical knowledge to back that up that's great or if you have the confidence to admit when you don't know that goes a long way too but that's not an easy thing to do for a lot of people in front of a group of people that are looking to you thinking that you're an expert because you're talking about a topic Brazil you want to go yeah I just wanted to quickly expand on what I was saying earlier um and I think you was you you just kind of said it I was gonna say both of you Brian and James I was gonna say that like even if people are like super senior Engineers or whatever they may be introductory to a specific topic and whenever I like write a talk or create content I'll give them a heads up like I'm not like going to be delivering this in a way that a senior software engineer can understand maybe like I'll be like this is like an introductory level um thing because I'm not as you know not as um experienced as other people so if you're looking for like a more detailed in-depth talk or content whatever go to this like other talk that's happening right now or that'll happen at 2PM that way I can get rid of not get rid of but avoid um some of the like challenging questions and people being like well you don't know anything but yeah I also wonder if there's such a thing as being you know too technically Adept at a certain topic because I think that the risk that you have is if you know there's a person with a PhD is talking about a topic uh what seems very natural and easy to them might be wildly complicated to other people and you have the real risk of losing people in the room because they just don't understand the fundamentals whereas you as a PhD person think that you know everyone should already know this right now right so I think there's definitely a concept of like being too technically deep and maybe that's where like being a a jack of all trades is really important in this industry where you you kind of want to touch upon everything but you don't really want to go too deep a lot of stuff unless that is you know the contract that you're writing at the time so we have uh pratim you have requested to speak I'm going to let you talk right now by the way for everyone else if you want to add to the conversation please do just raise your hand and let us know hey Paul before we move to the the next question there can I just add a little bit more on that sure I'm uh I'm struggling with photos UI right now where I'm smashing approve on on per team and it's not doing anything okay I think I'm out of work now okay um so what I was going to add there that I think uh ties into the tail end of that conversation is that something that I felt happened to me even before I was getting into devrel and I was just doing more publicly facing events or things was there was this this feel as you get more senior more experienced you need to share only more more of those high level things to kind of prove your experience a little bit right um and I think we need more we need to maybe take a step back from that in general and be more thoughtful about what about beginner friendly type of content beginner friendly educational type of uh resources to provide the people but I it's just something that I got caught up in I would say early on uh where I felt like I couldn't necessarily go back to facing the beginner type of stuff or learn something new and I only had to be an expert that have depth in one area to kind of prove myself I guess I'm curious if James or Brazil maybe have experienced or felt the same thing uh as part of their their roles [Music] go go I say I think I'm I'm too early in it in it so I just been on the beginner content haven't experienced it yet per team it looks like you uh something to say here not really I I can ask I have a quick question I have two questions actually I can go after James has added his point yeah I'll just do one quick note for me an interesting thing for me at this point in my career with creating content I feel like I'm especially from a speaking perspective actually kind of struggling to come up with deeper topics and this is part of a conversation I think that we can have more is I don't write production code anymore like I do demos and most of what we do endeavorell is simple demos so we actually kind of sacrifice some of the engineering knowledge and capability um so I actually at this point in my career I'm struggling a little bit to come up with like deeper technical topics to pitch for conferences um so that's just something that I'm kind of thinking through right now that's all I wanted to end uh so for team if if and when you're ready uh shoot absolutely dreams and I my question was is uh ranging around the same topic that as a developer Advocate uh in the end we are not the actual people who are putting the code on production we are not we it's good it's good to know the product in and out but I think it's a very big uh expectation to have that you should know the product equally well and in and out as the the core engineering team that works on it that's something I felt and in terms of the question um when you're giving talks when you're giving workshops there comes a point where there's someone who's way more senior than you in the audience or who's building with your product and they they ask you a very very particular question with a tech stack with your product and you genuinely don't have the answer and I've personally found it to be very awkward to say that hey I don't know this and to just redirect that person to the engineering team how do you handle such situations and what would your advice be oh uh I can go first here so in my experience I think that the worst thing you can do in a situation like that is to come up with an answer when you're not sure like basically try to think of something up on the spot like if you genuinely don't know the answer to a question I think there is absolutely no shame in just admitting that and just saying hey that's really interesting I don't know the answer to that question however I can help you figure out find someone who does know the answer to the question because the last thing you want is to give an incomplete or like an unsatisfying answer to someone which is just gonna get their back up more but I think you can definitely de-escalate a bit by uh yeah just kind of leading them down somewhere else what I also would suggest in the situations is that if you feel like they're taking up too much of your time like they keep trying to ask you follow-up question after a follow-up question about like a certain topic that you're not an expert in what I like to do is like those are very interesting questions but let's take this you know till after the presentation or whatever and let's talk some more about it later and free up some of this q a time for for someone else to ask question how about you guys how do you handle situations like that I recommend they come up on stage and do the presentation for me then definitely there's definitely people that like you can tell they're asking these questions just to kind of show off their knowledge and all that and and the reality of it there is you know like then why aren't they up on stage talking about it you know so um but on a positive note though I like what you said Paul and what I would add to that is you know that's that's feedback that you can use into the next time you might present that topic right you can maybe tweak your talk a bit based on that feedback that you received from somebody and and offer that and share that with them and say Hey you know I don't know that answer um but I'm going to research it and I'll you know this is helpful feedback that I can use you know for future iterations of this talk so foreign thank you so much I have another question is if that's okay yeah please go ahead yeah so my question is um is it really important to have a particular niche as a developer Advocate because now I've been working as a developer advocate for the last two years and I've been doing workshops I've been writing guides I've been doing community meetups I've been doing Partnerships Integrations literally every single uh area domain that comes in the developer advocacy I do it and I've done it pretty well so when people ask me what's your Niche I often tend to ask the same question to myself and is it actually is it really necessary to Niche down or it's fine to be a a generalist developer Advocate who can deliver well on all the topics resell I see your hand up I think you want to tackle this one right yeah I mean I'll try with the beginning so things um I wonder if like when people ask what's your Niche it's just because that's what they're used to asking and like they're they don't have like strong skills in the other settings like maybe they're good at video creation and then they're like what are you good at I don't think that should mean like oh I should have a niche too I think it's even more impressive that like you can um that you're able to deliver well on all of the all of the other things because I mean if anyone needs you for something you're able to jump in I think people are just aware of like where they are good at and what they do well kind of like with software engineering I know that everybody's like oh are you front end back end whatever and I know like saying oh I'm full stack sounds bad or like a lie or whatever but when I say I'm full stack I mean I'll figure out how to do it somehow like whatever the problem is I'll find it I'll find the answer so that's my thoughts I guess I'll just I'll just add to that and I'll hand it over to you after this James but like when it comes to like finding a niche I don't think it's a bad thing per se but I think that the the the criteria should be that rather than like finding something that you think has not been talked about before try to find something that you are genuinely passionate about and very interested about because if you try to like become the expert in like a certain ex you know uh framework or or a very obscure thing then uh that's great but it might not hold your attention for longer than before long it actually turns into a bit of a chore but if you if you have a genuine passion for something like um like cyber security for instance and you you really want to like go deep on that and and become the experts in that and I think that is fantastic just make sure that you have that passion behind it or it'll probably end up in tears well uh yeah just a minute James so why Niche I didn't mean a tech Niche uh so I I can code in JavaScript pretty well I I have been recording in Java by Niche I meant people tend to ask okay so do you do you completely focus on documentation or do you completely focus on Partnerships do you do only meetups do you do workshops in that sense yeah I can um I can jump in and kind of add to that um I for what it's worth I think you and I sound like we're in pretty similar votes um I've had conversations with managers doing during covet as we were coming out of covid uh where I had been doing a lot of live streaming and video and they were like well do you want to just continue to focus on that instead of going to conferences when conferences come back in person I was like no I love being in conferences I want to do that also and I think the potential there especially now that conferences are really starting to pick up and travel gets overwhelming or can be overwhelming really quickly the reality is you you kind of have to pick where you're going to sacrifice time to do other things and so being able to Niche down where you have one of them take a priority I think it makes it easier for you to prioritize your time and your energy because we can't do it all that's the that's um just kind of a given although similar to you I enjoy doing it all the other thing I think is useful to think about is um as you as you gain recognition and not just from an egotistical perspective but from a personal brand and a career perspective like you want to be recognized for the things that you're doing and a lot of times that's a lot easier if you have one thing that you're able to invest more energy in and is more recognizable and I think about this from an external brand perspective almost more so than internally like I feel like I've never done a good job of this but there are certain people and this they may consider this to limit themselves but there are certain people that I follow on Twitter or see at different places where I know that's the person that does this thing whether or not it's a tech category whether or not it's a Content category whatever it is because they've done that thing consistently and I've seen it over and over again I now think of that thing with them I associate that with them and that helps I think attach brand uh to yourself it attaches just consistency I think so again I'm in a similar boat I love doing all the things I love to stream I create video content I speak at conferences I think the thing that has had the biggest impact on my career the last couple of years is video content again that being something that I spend a lot of time outside of work doing and I'm able to leverage that into moving up from a career perspective making more money Etc but to your point it doesn't mean I don't also enjoy doing the other things that's just the thing that has carried more weight for me the past couple of years but it also doesn't mean that that's going to be the same thing that carries more weight the next couple of years that could change and I think Paul you had a good point of leveraging your excitement and passion to help guide you on which one of those things to give different levels of priorities at different times very well put here so we have a visual from the audience also had his hand up Michelle did you have a question or do you have anything you wanted to add to this I don't have a question I just wanted to add uh What uh James was saying about uh for the prathim's question so I would definitely say that uh like most of us in the world currently especially the one starting uh at early stage startups are startups or like solo Devils who are doing everything and I would say in when we think about Niche it's important for us to focus on like as we are doing everything uh focus on what we are liking the most and then uh trying to see what our strengths are in so that as the team grows as you are the one that who started uh the devil program at this particular company and you're the solo devil when you are expanding the team uh by that time we should be able to know what we are strong at and what we want to work on so that we can delegate the other responsibilities uh to the new develop folks that we are trying to hire so I would just categorize them into like uh developer education developer evangelism developer community and also like uh yeah this research and uh I would say when someone asks about the niche try to categorize all your responsibilities into one of these and uh just let them know what you like the most so that they will also connect you as a person with this particular Niche uh as it also defines kind of opportunities that we want to work with them or just for them might be in future yeah I completely agree and um as with like it's like with many answers to these kind of questions it's kind of like uh it depends like what are you what are you interested in what are you doing so I wanted to move on to another topic really so this is something that James was talking about earlier which if it was actually very interesting I want to touch upon a bit more so I think a lot of developer Advocates start off life as an engineer or like a product engineer and then they kind of transition into this type of role and uh I don't know about you guys but for me it was a bit of a struggle kind of moving away from from writing production codes to still writing code but the code that I write now is more uh for like samples and examples and doesn't end up in production I want to know it was it was difficult for me I want to hear about you guys like was it a struggle for you or was it an easy transition like what were your thoughts about this maybe uh Brian you want to go first sure I would say yeah I agree it was a struggle but I think about it from the other side when I was in an engineering role you had very strict limitations on what you could work on and uh you know what new things you can kind of pull in maybe you're interested in new technology maybe you're interested in learning a new programming language and as a result of that you're kind of you know you have to do that on your own time right and it doesn't get tied into your actual work for your job when it comes to this role though like now I have more of that freedom I can spend that time focusing on the things that I'm most interested in and most passionate about within the industry so yes I definitely I agree with that but like glass half full it's like now I have that freedom to kind of expand upon what I get to focus on what about you James yeah I'll give this I'll give the reverse of this because I think I'm one of not as many people in devrel that actually started with Devereaux fresh out of college and a little bit of context for myself as a developer coming out of college I got really good grades and I didn't know what the hell I was doing when I graduated like I had a few technical interviews and bomb because I focused on getting good grades I didn't appreciate what I was doing I didn't really know what I was doing and to be quite honest it's embarrassing looking back at where I was but that's just part of the journey so I joined as a developer Advocate and I'm having to learn our technical evangelist and I'm having to learn all these things how to give presentations how to network how to go out and be a part of the community and that stuff went really well and I built lots of professional skills there that I will carry with the rest of my life and I think that a hundred percent was a big factor in being able to make different careers uh steps and progressions uh throughout my career but I didn't I still didn't learn much technical stuff and I ended up putting myself in situations where I gave workshops to high school students and University students I did a lot of game making stuff that wasn't super technical it was a lot of fun but it was abstracted away from code and I kind of sacrificed um my learning journey by starting in developer advocacy or technical evangelism right after college then I went to software engineering and just in three years became a hundred percent different developer actually being able to do that full time was an absolute game changer for me it's not it's just an experience that you won't get in my mind uh in most devrel opportunities so for me in my career I 100 needed that opportunity to write code on a consistent basis to see what real world applications and problems look like and now I'm a completely different developer Advocate because of that so I think it would be hard to make an entire career out of developer advocacy I think having the actual engineering background at some point in your career whether it's first or middle or last I don't think it matters that much but having that at some point makes you a different developer Advocate it enables you to have more technical conversations and opens yourself up to being able to talk to more technical audiences so do you feel that not having that experience would be like a detriment to your developer advocacy career like can you can you like strive to go the highest levels of advocacy without having like product engineering experience I think you can like I'm I'm not one to go all the way to Absolute so I think you can and I think part of that would depend on the product on the team and how much technical knowledge is needed to do that job because the reality is like we we can kind of assume evangelists and Advocates are for a technical product but they don't necessarily have to be but I do think um I do think you'll hit a wall in terms of the audiences you can talk to now what that means relevant to the product and the company that you're at and the target audience that you're going for Depends obviously on the company but I think you do limit yourself on how deep you can go and the types of audiences that you can engage with by not having that Hands-On Real World experience that the other developers that you're talking to will have do you think that also limit yourself a little bit I'm just kind of thinking of uh if you wanted to get a developer advocacy job elsewhere like certain companies you know they they make you pass a full interview engineering interview to be able to become a developer Advocate whereas others are are less strict that way so I wonder if not having an experience at all also kind of like pigeonholes you in in a certain area it could one of the interesting things I posted on Twitter recently was a question of how many people in their career have have never had to do a whiteboarding interview and an overwhelming amount of people not not Advocates or evangelists but just developers had said I've never done one of those so I think those are probably less common than we hyped them up to be for a lot of people and we have the judgment on whether or not that's the best way to gauge people's technical knowledge Etc I think it it depends on the companies the opportunities Etc and the big recommendations I have for people is as you're looking at career paths as you're looking at potential companies that you want to work for do your research and figure out what skills you do or do not have that you'll need to get to that next step or that company and you can do that by reaching out to recruiters looking at job postings to see what they list there reach out to current employers like I all I'm a huge believer and you should do your research and let the research in terms of what your next career steps look like have that be the biggest influence on what you do to get there I am by the way hugely envious of anyone who has never had to do a whiteboarding exercise during an interview that they are the absolute worst and yet everyone still does them it's ridiculous I've done I've done my uh my dues I've done the Google interview twice in person that was fun yeah they make it yeah I'm just getting off topic slightly here but why do they have to be like five hours long it's insane not better at all so I guess kind of following up from that um if you let's say that you you like have become a developer Advocate I think you started office developer Advocates um if you wanted to jump back into a pure engineering role like how easy is that do you think like how how should they kind of be seen as like a uh like a lateral move can you jump from one to the other kind of whenever you want or is there's kind of like a a different skill sets all together and I see Jay Miller has just joined us I'm gonna get you up here as a speaker because I think you might have some thoughts in this as well hopefully can you hear me yeah yeah my internet's been like wild all morning big Coast Synergy like big internet blocking energy I guess um yeah I I love that question I love that I kind of came in on that question too because I just asked this question two days ago um I I mean I feel like devrel and being a developer Advocate is like the role for me but I also you know deal with anxiety and like I have you know all my own things that like keep me from being able to fully say like I am amazing at this role and I actually talked to one of uh my mentors and uh he's also a like principal engineer and I was like well you know I wanted to get into Tech to get into devrel and I kind of skipped to getting into Tech part but now I'm leveling up some of those engineering skills would it be easier to now move into engineering if things didn't work out which again a whole lot of negative energy not not too happy with that but that's okay therapy like and then the other side of that you know the thing that he said kind of caught my attention was like honestly I feel like you would better be suited as a PM because you know you know like all sides of the project you know you can write the code you can do the organizational side of it you can do the talking to it and like you speak all the languages and honestly that's something that PMS are are super uh you know that's that's a huge request is you know you don't want someone that that doesn't necessarily know anything about the project and then you also don't want you know someone who can't speak to the project effectively to Executive leadership or you know higher ups so to me I don't I don't think necessarily can you go back to engineering absolutely but I think with those Newfound skills I think you've also unlocked the opportunity to go into other areas that you may not have thought of before one of those being like project management now that you mentioned it actually I know several former developer Advocates who are now in project management and I can't believe I never really made that link before but yeah you're absolutely right um what about you James and Brian do you think like uh I guess can't two part question first of all would you ever consider jumping back into a pure engineering role and I guess second question like how hard would that be for you uh Brian you want to go first sure I was going to play Rock Paper Scissors go ahead um would I ever consider going back into an engineering role yeah absolutely I it depends on the situation the company and the type of work though uh you know if the stars aligned for that sure um I don't have any any plans for that right now um but maybe in the future and then what was the second question Paul was like how difficult do you think that would be like if I if I asked you to go and do a five hour whiteboarding exercise right now would you be like sure no problem roll up your sleeves or would you be like uh no thank you uh honestly I'd move on and interview somewhere else because it's the correct answer yeah um I mean unless the I don't know I I say that lightly but like if it was like a dire situation I'll do whatever needs to be done they'll support my family and myself and that kind of thing so I don't want to uh make light of that but if given the situation I have the opportunity to say no I don't want to do that and I can interview somewhere else then I would do that um but yeah I think Jay hid it really well in terms of like I think this this role can and does set you up for success to uh make changes in your career to switch within within this industry uh the type of role you want to have for your career and that evolves over time like you see like you said you saw people move into uh product management there's people that like manage in devrel and then they could translate those skills to be a manager of Engineers potentially you know um so I think there's a lot of opportunity coming from experience in this role that we set ourselves up for one thing that I personally experienced not too long ago I was at a conference um and some of our sales people were there and I was just talking with them getting to know them and they were kind of like trying to recruit me into sales because they feel that folks that are in devrel kind of again piggybacking on what Jay was saying that we have we have very uh desired skills in the sense that we can speak to the technical aspects of things but then also communicate you know we have a lot of background and experience being able to communicate these ideas and and Concepts that can help Drive sales even you know I don't have any interest in that but I'm just saying like this this type of role helps really um I don't know just set you up for success I would say teaches you how to talk to humans what about you James would you uh would you ever consider an engineering position again um yeah again like no absolutes but probably not and the reason is like I think combination of content and a few other things is just for the very foreseeable future is the stuff that I enjoy but the cool thing is that I can tie those things back because I see a point where like I've done a lot of content but I would like to get into building a SAS and building like microsass stuff micro assassins micros yeah anyway multiple micro SAS products build multiple uh Sasa yes microssi but I love to build stuff I love to learn and I think that's kind of the experience from a technical perspective that I feel like I'm missing sometime that's the thing that would give it to me is just like go build something and realize what the limitations are of the tools that you do basic tutorials on so I think that would be more of my approach to getting more uh technical or kind of scratching that itch if you will the idea of transitioning back into an engineering role and being successful or how difficult that would be for me like I don't mean this from a cocky perspective and I have no doubts in my ability to do that and I think we've touched a little bit on there's a lot that I can bring to the table to a development team in addition to my engineering skills my ability to communicate as we said my ability to lead my ability to understand the product and translate the needs of the business to a technical solution that's stuff that is second nature to me and I would say one of my strengths also I went into my role at FedEx having no actual engineering experience whatsoever and again if you were here earlier you heard how embarrassed I am for my lack of technical knowledge graduating college but just the Hands-On stuff is what makes the difference like that's why as a mentor as a teacher we preach about going and building stuff and realizing what those limitations are Etc because that's the best learning experience so I think I would I would have less technical knowledge than someone had a senior level coming into the role but I think I would ramp up really quickly because I learned on a consistent basis I'm passionate about what I do I'm excited about what I do which makes it easier to learn and I think those other skills that I've been developing and practicing over the course of 10 plus years of doing something related to developer advocacy will also carry a lot of weight and my one of the things I stress for people especially early on in their career is to understand the fact that like being a good engineer is more than just writing code it's about a lot of other things that play into it that you can bring experience to the table even when you lack some of the engineering experience be out 100 and um just to kind of uh we've been talking about like you know the negative stuff like uh Hey what if uh if I want to leave the advocacy Etc but I want to actually want to talk about the the complete opposite of that which is something I think that is not super well defined or explored because Dev advocacy as a whole I think is relatively new as a job path in the last couple years it's really taken off I would say in the last decade or so with the uh on event of you know live live streaming videos and YouTube Etc but what is like what is the peak of deaf advocacy look like like how far can you go in a career in advocacy like what what we kind of strive to because in an engineering world you can kind of when you think like a big tech companies they have you know the different different levels they get staff engineer principal engineer Architects Etc but what does that look like for a developer advocate I mean honestly like I I think about this not even from like the tech background but almost from like my military background where you know previously like I was in the Marine Corps and you get to a certain point where you have a split and it's either technical or administrative um you know you have a master sergeant or first sergeant and I mean honestly it takes a while to get there usually these are people who are like 15 going on 20 years in but they have to make that decision and that decision kind of moves them for the rest of their their career path and and on the tech side I kind of see a similar path of like you know you can be a principal Advocate you can be a I mean I don't know if they have staff like Advocates but I'm sure some company will have one eventually um you stay there long enough they'll be like we don't know what to do with you so we're just gonna start making up stuff um and then the other side of that is kind of moving it down that management path and I mean to me that's that's actually the route that I want to take like I feel like in my career I've always been better at enabling other people to go further than I could have ever gone so for me like I want to go down the management path I want to be you know a different manager eventually a director of devrel um I don't know I mean again I'm sure at some some companies will probably have like a VP of developer relations um and like that's kind of the path that I want to go because to me it's not necessarily about the skills that I have it's the skills that I can kind of help unlock in other people what about you James I think like technically you're your own manager right yeah first off Jay you're going to make all of us look selfish and terrible after you just focus on what you're able to provide other people in your entire answer so congrats on that um I think one of the cool things one of the most interesting things about Deborah is the amount of things that you are exposed to and have to learn that could be individual career paths in themselves and so a few examples of that from a Content creation perspective you could get really big into video audio live streaming Etc from a speaking perspective you can build up your speaking profile and go on to be a professional speaker from a product perspective you can be really in tune with a product team and how they ship features and why and how they get feedback from a community perspective you can go out and learn how to build communities and grow communities and be genuine developers from a marketing perspective you can pay really close attention to how you Market to developers and developer audiences Etc so there's lots of different things that you have the ability to get exposed to and also then soak in that knowledge while also bringing a unique perspective that let's be honest not that many people in the world have from a developer advocacy perspective because there's not that many people partially because it's a newer thing but just not that many people who have the desire to do some of the social aspect of what we do some of the other aspects that are not code in addition to the technical stuff so when you look at like what's the future of devrel I see people in devrel going on to lead marketing to lead product Etc and an example of that is my director at osiro my VP at Planet scale um Jared he was a developer Advocate at twilio went into management then became director of developer marketing authiro a VP of marketing at Planet scale and that's the regression right like those are the things that he was able to pay attention to as a developer Advocate and use that to progress in his career and I think um Jay you had a good point and this is pretty standard I think the the kind of diverging Paths of being on a technical path versus a leadership path and those are not necessarily mutually exclusive but it is really hard to go continue to go up and up as a developer Advocate from a technical perspective without going into management and Leadership of some sort because you only have at any given company you only have one or two of those people who can do it at that level the combination of Technical and other skills that come along with it so I think a lot of the like you start to look long term my careers in developer advocacy it's the potential to be a leader in a lot of different areas I think that uh you hit the nail in the head and also it's kind of what Jay was saying earlier is that one of the things that you really learn from being a developer Advocate is how to communicate to people so not not just communicating difficult and complicated technical Concepts to people but you also just learn how to talk to human beings in general which is perhaps a skill that bore Engineers should know in general so I think that yeah like going into Management in particular what Jay was referring to is such a um I don't know if it feels like it could be very natural for a lot of developer Advocates that I know because we're just naturally very likable people and I think would do very well in a management position like I've uh in my career developer uh uh advocacy I mean the best manager I've ever had have been previous developer Advocates because I think they know how to communicate and how to talk to people as well what about you Brian what do you think about this topic like how how far can you go in advocacy do you think well one I'm not feeling like James is as likable anymore because he keeps challenging me to rock paper scissors and you know I don't I don't like that challenge it's pretty aggressive paper scissors I see I see a future Tick Tock in our uh in our future I think so I think so man um so Paul I I would when you were asking this question about Peak Dev advocacy and um and all that my immediate thought I know this wasn't what the question was but my immediate thought was like what's been the biggest uh draw in for me for developer advocacy and that's been like the community aspect of it is what kind of keeps me fired up and going um because there's like as a being in this type of role it's helped me make connections with people like you all here for instance right that I never would have made probably connections with had I been in my engineering role and stick to my normal Tendencies of just kind of keeping to myself maybe keeping to my immediate team and not really putting myself out there more and so I think that's the part that I'm most grateful for in a role like this is the the community aspect of that and just seeing that kind of expand you know and coming across and getting to meet more people from different backgrounds and experiences and and learning from each other and the other aspect of that that I've seen really be amazing is the community kind of rallying around each other as a result of this like things where layoffs are happening and people like really coming together to try and find open positions to help you know place somebody that just got impacted by that kind of stuff um that's been you know on like uh more human level not technical aspect of a Dev advocacy position that I've seen um just be really amazing and that and that's what makes me really enjoy being in this part of a role in industry so that's actually um a a really good topic that I wanted to bring up as well which is kind of the almost the elephant in the room which is job security right so in the last couple of months uh everyone's seen the news of layoffs happening at companies at specifically tech companies and uh it seems like you know whenever layoffs happening in an engineering organization that devrel seems to be one of the teams that are on the very top of the list for The Chopping Block so there's there's definitely this kind of anxiety of being in devrel and develop advocacy in general of you know what is my job security actually like am I just one economic downturn from being out of a job and if that happens like you know how am I going to find new work do you guys feel like if you have that kind of anxiety as well or do you feel like it's not as pessimistic as I'm making it out to be I see for Tim you want to uh weigh in on this one yeah I I I've been thinking on the similar uh terms for a very long time since we've been hearing so many talks and with such big companies laying off people to be honest and yes the anxiety is there it's pretty much there but at the same time whenever I whenever I talk to people people from the industry it's it's obvious that as long as we know that we are good at the art and as long as we are actually uh basically as as any job right like if you're a good developer you're always going to be in demand so as long as you're good at the art there is gonna be good demand for it this is something that I could catch from all the conversation that I had with friends around the industry very good point so um James I kind of want to ask you about this because uh you know obviously you you have exp unfortunately had a very recent experience with this but have has your thoughts on the matter kind of changed do you feel like I don't know Egypt about the industry or I'd love to hear your your uh thoughts on this um yeah I feel like and and for what it's worth everyone we talked about this beforehand so Paul's not putting me on the spot but happily I feel like I'm gonna become the spokesperson for people that have been let go from companies or at least one of the people that's really vocal about it and I know James Perkins was in the chat or in the Stream earlier um and he went through a similar situation it was very transparent about it uh but I got uh let go from planet scale in July and I've been doing full-time content since so for me personally and having already had a lot of things in place this has been like one of the best opportunities that I've been able to take advantage of ever which is super exciting but the flip side is like I mean this is happening like people in Denver are getting laid off fairly often if you're in Denver I don't want to scare you and you'll have to have conversations and kind of see where your company and everything is at at the time but there it was it was wild when I posted my thing one of my friends sent me a message to say hey so sorry that you got uh let go uh 10 minutes later they came back and said well I just got let go too another friend of mine I got let go a few weeks ago another person just got let go a few days ago so there is lots of that happening and I do think from an industry perspective it is very common and easy to see devrel as a first one to go uh it does seem a little Expendable or expensible I don't know what the right word is there um at times it's just an easier thing to not be able to defend a lot of that again is because it's newer it's because a lot of the metrics and things that we track are not necessarily tied to Dollars which a lot of times is the priority so it kind of makes sense but it also does make it a little bit scary another flip side to that is when when this happened to me I posted online saying I'm not sure what I'm gonna do next but if anyone's hiring devereller or ahead of deveral opportunity send me a message and I must have got a hundred different messages from people with open Deborah or head of Deborah L positions either open or will be open in the next couple of months so I don't think there's I don't think it's scary to the point where there's not opportunities but I think it is worth considering that this is happening more and more unfortunately so it's something to at least be cognizant about and I think one big piece of advice that I have is for people that are in devrel start to be a little bit more uh selfish with what your personal brand is because your experience at a company will carry over some but your personal brand is something that's going to carry over with you forever and when I talk about getting so many messages from people about hiring and Deborah when I got let go that's because of me building a reputation and building a brand for myself over the course of several years so me personally I'm not that worried about it because I feel like it would be easy for me to find a job but I understand 100 that that's coming from a place of of having this already in place and being privileged by that fact so it is a reality I think that it's happening a lot more I think it's something to be cognizant cognizant about if you have a family and you can't go through that situation and you want to go a safer route for something like a traditional engineering role do what works best for you but if you're gonna continue to do different well actually regardless of what you continue to do put a little bit more effort into your personal brand and think about how that's going to go with you from job to job and the rest of your career and the benefits that can come along with that obviously still being respectful for the company and the product that you represent but think about how you can leverage your personal brand a little bit more be a little bit more selfish and kind of set yourself up for more opportunities in the future if something does go sideways yeah so I mean first of all I just want to say thank you for so much for kind of opening up and talking about this kind of stuff because this is you know it's it's not an easy topic and it's also must be really difficult to talk about for for anyone really um but yeah I would 100 agree on the the personal brand thing and and kind of to to make it sound a bit happier one of the things that I want to highlight as well is like what what Brian was saying is that um the devrel community is strong right so if you do happen to find yourself in a situation where you have lost your job uh I've also seen like on Twitter and on LinkedIn that that people tend to like pull together and they flock and they find jobs for people who need it because even even though things can look a little dicey with all the layoffs um layoffs are big news but people hiring is not right so for every layoff that you see there's always there's probably more devrel jobs opening up in general I like to think anyway um AJ you requested to speak do you have a question or anything you would like to add here hey uh thanks Paul um I'm a developer Advocate I've been a developer advocate for about three years now and I wanted to join in the chat a little earlier when we were talking about uh when you like ask questions about moving back into software engineering and such uh so I requested access but at this point I'm just here to hang out and listen to some questions and if there's anything of value I can share I would love to if that's okay with the group sure thanks AJ uh Jay or Brian anything you want to add to uh the talk about like a job security um I mean I think the easiest thing to do is the more you continue to communicate with people in the back channel the better off you are like I mean I'm waiting for James to come out with his sassy labs and like oh wait no that's that's a YouTube channel already it's sassy apps um so he can build his SAS micro services and say hey I need a manager of devrel and I'm gonna be like hey James I remember when you were talking about this let's let's chat about it I think I think we got something here uh and you know sold see there that that's how it works like I I criticize heavily um I'm on record criticizing heavily people that that spend more time focusing on like this is how you succeed in devrel then like actually doing devrel but I also acknowledge that that's how you continue to thrive in the industry like I I think that there's that balance and if you balance it well you can work with any company you can work with your you know your fellow members in the back Channel because they they've heard you they've seen you they've seen you try to contribute to what they're doing and and build them up but I think I think the that's those are the skills that you need to be able to make those those migrations and and like you said when layoffs happen and they they do happen you know I think that's when it's time to to see how you've been playing the last few hands we just had layoffs at the beginning of this week as well fortunately it wasn't impacted by it but uh the only thing I'll add is like just with any role I think it Ebbs and flows like there's like over the past year I felt like there was a huge demand and the devrel positions were what was like booming and maybe that's starting to come to a you know the the valley of that flow or that Trend right now um but I think the other the other aspect that I'll add to this in terms of like devrel and the stickiness of it I guess is it depends on the company too and like how the company sets up the devrel heart team or organization within the overall organization is it is it set up for success is it got the right um intention behind it for what the executive leadership is expecting of a devrel organization to accomplish and what benefit it does and that's when you get into some of the the weeds of like where where does a devrail team fit best in overall organization is it best in a marketing team is it best on a product team or Standalone on its own and Reporting up to leadership all that I think is still I don't know the answer to that for me personally but I think that factors into the overall success of a devrel team at an organization whether or not it's on the chopping block when layoffs need to happen or not so I don't want to end on a super pessimistic note here but we are getting towards the the end of our time together um so what we usually do at the end here is that we tend to ask each one of our panelists to kind of like share something that they want to Hype or something they want to talk about just in the last couple of minutes so I really hope you guys came up with something like wholesome and nice to kind of offset the pessimism but um who would like to go first James Bryan and Jay any of you guys anything we want to share anything you want to Hype up or shout outs this week I'm going to yield rock paper scissors to my future director at uh CEO James I love this we got to come up with some way they capitalize this on this from a tick tock perspective or something uh if you want to have fun go and follow me on Tick Tock that's been fun I did a video this morning on uh estimates like you give an estimate to somebody and then all of a sudden a manager is like you didn't meet your estimate and it's going to go on your personal record I'm like that's an estimate that's not how these things work uh anyway if you want to have fun with that I'm on Tick Tock also Izzy is leaving lots of reactions um and she is on Tick Tock as well that I follow so go and check her out and there's lots of other fun names in here too so go and check out everybody else in the chat or I say chat like I'm streaming uh in the Twitter space but Tick Tock can be a lot of fun can be too much fun I spend too much time there but it is a fun space so James key quick on Tick Tock thanks everyone for having me been a ton of fun thank you all right Brian anything you'd like to share with us uh Jay how about you go next all right that's that's fair um I'm speaking at a couple of places one of my favorite online conferences pajamas it's like uh it's the conference where you roll out of bed in your pajamas and you give a talk and then you go back to bed like I I love this this idea um I'm gonna be talking about the campaign that I ran for October which was you know 31 days of neurodiversity I have ADHD PTSD and a few other things and I wanted to encourage folks to be able to share anonymously uh words of encouragement for other people that might be seeking a diagnosis and that involved a bunch of stuff with Azure I work for Microsoft and you know all that stuff so I'm talking about that but also python 311 just came out this week and I did like the biggest post energy blog post of my life like quite literally when I say 2500 words seven interviews uh before the post even came out like I think it was a 150 comments uh through our GitHub you know post and then over 50 like changes and amendments and it took like a month and a half to put together so uh luckily it's been received really well but if you want to go check that out you can check it out on the Microsoft Dev blog I put a lot of sweat and anxiety into it but uh yeah I was I was I was hyping up big post energy the last time but I'm coming true on my words this time so go check that out you had me at Big post energy for sure I will definitely check that out Brian would you mind just think of something in that uh in that big post energy rent not really but I do want to call out Jay inspiring me with the big post energy stuff because I started writing more for work and uh it's been it's been fun thanks to that inspiration so um the posts don't got to be words they can be they can be voice they can be tick tocks big posts boom boom let's go true true yeah uh I guess one thing I'll shout out is that I do live streams on Twitch twitch.tv slash Clark IO clarkio uh where I make a fool of myself and I I learn live in front of people and we have a fun Community there so check that out sometime if you're interested thank you all right and with that I'd like to say a big thank you to the panelist James Brian J and rizelle who had to miss out to skip the last half of this earlier I forgot to mention but thank you so much to them and thank you to everyone here who is listening if you enjoyed this you know drop us a tweet drop us a follow uh we try to do these on at least a monthly basis and have a great rest of your day and we'll catch you next time bye [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'fjkY_hzLrbY', 'title': 'StripeDev Live: Struggles of a Developer Advocate part 3', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 225, 'thumbnail_url':

episode you're going to learn how to accept a one-time payment using a custom form with the payment element if you're looking for a simpler integration path we have the no code payment links option where you can set up a payment link directly through the dashboard and then share that with your customers through social media email text message Etc alternatively there's another option called stripe checkout this is a a very simple integration that has one API call on the server you redirect your customer to a stripe hosted page but in today's episode we're going to talk about integrating the payment element this allows you to build your own custom hosted form and collect lots of different payment method types so the payment element supports anything from cards all the way to bank accounts you've got support for wallets like Google pay and Apple pay all the way to buy now pay later like a firm and after pay clear pay so it is a great option for building your own custom form to accept a one-time payment so just as a quick roadmap for today we're going to install sample then we're going to go through the dashboard and talk about how you can enable payment methods these are going to be those payment methods that are dynamically rendered into the payment element every time the page loads and then we're going to create a payment intent on the server and use its client secret to render the payment element on the client so that we can collect payment details from the customer it will ultimately submit that payment to stripe and we're going to handle any of those post-processing events we're going to talk about web Hooks and a few other considerations that you might want to think about as you're building out your integration so let's get into it so we're in Visual Studio code if you haven't already head over to the extension gallery and install the strip for vs code extension we're going to use the striper vs code extension today to install a stripe sample so under samples we're going to say start with a stripe sample we're going to search for starter and we're going to use the main integration with an HTML client and we're using PHP on the server today we'll call our sample starter Dash PHP and we can pick where we want this example to be cloned down into hit OK and we're going to open this up in the same window and we should be Off to the Races now with PHP we're going to implement the client a little bit differently than all of the other samples so we can actually delete this client directory and then we can take a look at what's inside of the server directory so it's going to come with a DOT end that should be pre-populated if you've already sort of logged into the stripe CLI and authenticated the striper vs code extension with your stripe account if you haven't then you'll want to go over to dot end and make sure that you've populated these API keys with those keys from your stripe dashboard there is another video on the channel talking about authentication which you can search for and you'll find how to set your API Keys now in this public directory we've already got an index.php file there's actually not any PHP in here yet but this is where we're going to collect our payment details and build our form we've also got this shared.php which is loading all of our dependencies using composer it's also doing some checks on our DOT environment variables and finally it is initializing an instance of the stripe PHP client library that we're going to use to make API calls to stripe now we can actually remove this setup info section and hit save now the web hook Handler is also already sort of pre-configured for us and allows us to just start dropping in event types that we want to listen for and handle and we'll come back to that in the very end so this is the the stripe sample let's also open up the terminal here and install some dependencies we're going to CD into the server directory and say composer install now if you don't already have composer set up you can head over and take a look at the documentation about how to install composer and now we're going to say composer start and this will fire up our PHP server and allow us to receive connections all right now our server is up and running we can come over to the browser and hit refresh at localhost 4242 and we are up and running now from the stripe dashboard we can head over to the settings and to the payment method settings this is where we can manage our payment methods and enable or disable different ways that customers can pay through our payment element so you'll see here that we have cards enabled link Apple pay Google pay several different wallet methods there's lots of different bank redirects these are popular across Europe we also have some buy now pay later payment methods that are enabled finally we even have ACH direct debit as one of the payment methods that customers could use now if we wanted to enable Canadian pre-authorized debits we could click turn on and this would enable us to use Canadian pre-authorized debits as a payment method type inside of our payment flows so this is where we manage our payment methods and these are the payment methods that will be dynamically derived inside of our payment element when we render that and show it to customers so that's how you enable and manage your payment methods instead of needing to deploy any new code you can just come into the dashboard and enable or disable different payment method types alright so here is a high level overview of the process that we're going to implement today when a customer lands on the page our application is going to make an API call to stripe to create a payment intent then that payment intent is going to return back to the client we're going to use that client secret property in order to render the payment element so that's the first step in the first process that we're going to implement today so let's jump back into vs code all right so inside of our index.php file here we're going to open up some PHP script and we're going to say that we want to require the shared PHP thing that's going to initialize and set up our dependencies from composer and also that stripe client because we have The Strife for vs code extension installed we can say stripe payment intent create and hit Tab and that will show us the the default API call that we would need to use in order to create a payment intent now the amount here we're going to just hard code 10.99 this is an integer value in the smallest denomination for a given currency right now the currency is set to USD we could also make this Euros if we wanted but one thing to note is that this amount you can calculate this however you want right now we're hard coding it but you could for instance have a this index.php accept a post request that included for instance maybe a like a product ID that you would then use to look up the product in the database and then pull out the amount the unit amount that you need to charge for that product and then you can pass in that unit amount here while you're creating this payment intent so we're hard coding it today but you could use whatever data that is passed to you in order to calculate this amount one thing you don't want to do is accept a raw integer value from the front end in order to create the payment intent the reason you don't want to do that is a malicious user could potentially modify the HTML or modify the request and pass in whatever amount they want and so it's a best practice to pass in some reference or some identifier to then derive 5 the amount that should be charged instead of hard coding the list of payment method types we're also going to use a different feature here called automatic payment methods so we're going to say automatic payment methods is enabled true this is going to help us by allowing us to derive the payment method types that we want to render in the payment element and those payment method types are the ones we just set up in the stripe dashboard so this API call is going to return a payment intent we're going to use this payment intense client secret down below when we write some JavaScript okay so this is really the server side bit in order to create the payment intent pretty straightforward now there's lots of different options for creating payment intents so head over to the stripe documentation look at the API reference for creating payment intents and you'll be able to see which of those are applicable to your business all right now we want to use this payment intent client side in order to render the payment element so a couple things that we need to do we're going to require some JavaScript I'm going to drop this in right before the closing body tag at the bottom of our HTML file here so the script source of this first one is going to be uh js.stripe.com V3 now we always want to load stripe.js from js.stripe.com we don't want to pre-fetch that or you know we don't want to Cache that anywhere so that we always have the latest version so this is a best practice now we also want to create our own little script tag here that we're going to use in order to mount the payment element so we're going to create a new instance of stripe and this is expecting our publishable key so the publishable key is available in the environment so we're going to pass in this stripe we're going to pass in the stripe purple triple key like so and then we're going to close out our sort of short rendering okay now that we have an instance of stripe what we need to do is create an element screw so we're going to say elements is striped elements now in the past we just called elements and we didn't have any arguments we passed in but now with the payment element we actually want to pass in the client secret for the payment intent that we just created so this is going to be payment intent client secret now this payment intent client secret comes from this payment intent that was just created with the API server side before this front end was rendered now we're going to use the elements group to create a new element called the payment element we're going to say elements.create payment and that will be an element that we can mount into a form so in order to mount this payment element we need to have some HTML set up so let's come up here we're going to say this is called like accept a payment and we need a form so we're going to create a new form here and this is going to be called the payment form inside of our payment form we're going to have a div that's going to be our payment element we're also going to have a button that just says pay and finally we'll have another div here for our error messages anything that fails while we are attempting payment we can render out here okay so now that we have this payment element div inside of our form now we can mount the payment element so now we can say payment element.mount and pass in the CSS selector for the payment element now when we head over and refresh our page we should see the payment element rendered here and we do so this is the the payment element if we wanted to we could go through this process and fill out this this entire form notice there are several different payment method types here these are all enabled through the stripe dashboard if we were to switch this from euros to USD save and refresh the page notice that different payment method types are rendered because depending on the currency some payment method types support certain currencies others will support others so this is how we can initialize and set up the payment element in order to render on our custom form we could also Imagine collecting other details around this having input boxes maybe for you know if we needed to collect information about the customer's size or their birthday or some other information we can build that into our custom form here but the one thing we're not doing yet is handling the submission of the form so let's do that next in order to handle submissions of this form we want to do that with JavaScript so that we can submit payment client-side back to Stripes we're going to grab reference to the form using document.getelementbyid passing in payment form as the identifier then we're going to add an event listener on submit so that each time the form is submitted we're going to actually prevent default for the event so the form is not fully submitted back to the server instead we want to handle this client side and we're going to call stripe.confirm payment passing in this options block now the first thing we want to include in the options block is reference to this elements group so we're going to drop in the elements we also want to drop in a confirm params option that is going to include a return URL this is the URL to which the customer is going to be redirected after they go through the payment flow we're just going to pull this off the window so window.location.href and we're going to split on the question mark and that'll allow us to remove any query string arguments and then we're just going to add complete.php that'll be where we redirect the customer to this newcomplete.php script that we haven't actually written yet now confirm payment returns a promise and that might resolve with an object that has an error property on it and if that's the case then we want to use this error messages div to render back those error messages so we're going to say if there was an error then populate that message as div we're going to say messages is document.getelement by ID and we'll set messages inner text equal to error.message all right let's take this thing for a spin so we refresh the page we're going to enter in this special 4242 card number it's just all four two four twos and a future expiration any CBC and any zip code and we're going to click on pay now that is going to again submit the payment client side all the payment details are going client-side to stripe then we're redirected to this complete dot PHP file notice that there is a query string parameter that includes the ID of the payment intent it also includes the client secret for the payment intent so we can re we can either re-retrieve the payment intent server side or client side in order to display those details so let's create a new file and talk about how we're going to build that completion page next okay so we're going to create a new file here we're going to save it and call it complete.php and this again is going to have reference to our our shared script so that we can load the API keys and dependencies so we're going to require share.php and then we're going to make an API call to strive to pull back our payment intent that we just went through the payment flow for so we're going to say stripe payment intents retrieve and we're going to pass in the ID of the payment intent that is again included inside of the query string params Under payment intent let's just grab some of this HTML so that we can reuse it and we'll drop it in here this will allow us to have just a little bit of style already okay we'll call this page complete and for now we'll just put a pre-tag here that will render out the Json in code for the payment intent so that we can see it and it looks nice on the page we can see all of the Json for that payment intent so we'll refresh the page now and now we are seeing this completion page with all of the data about the payment intent and at the very bottom we can see the status of the payment intent is succeeded if you are using some of the delayed payment method types like ACH or another one of the bank debit types it's possible that it takes a couple of days for that payment to clear so this might be in a pending State there's several different reasons why you might want to display the status and maybe the amount you can pull a lot of different information off of this payment intent to tell your customer what their order number is and details about the payment intent so that is how we can build a completion page this return URL or completion page is a great place to confirm with the customer and let them know that their payment has gone through successfully but it's not a good place to handle any fulfillment automations it's possible that between submitting payments successfully to stripe and redirecting to this page the customer's internet went down their Network went down or their computer died there's several different reasons why they might not actually make it to this page and your server might not receive the request for this complete.php page it's that reason that we want to use web hooks for all fulfillment web hooks are superior because if your server is down for some reason stripe will retry sending you a notification about this event for up to three days with exponential back off so let's take a look at our web hook Handler inside of our public directory we've already got this set up now we are listening for the payment intent that succeeded webhook event type you'll also want to listen to payment intent.pending or payment intent.payment failed there's several different event types that you could listen for you can head over to the stripe documentation for the entire list but what I wanted to do is quickly run through how you might test your web hook endpoint using the strifer vs code extension with our our setup today so what we want to do is we're going to go to the straightfor vs code extension we're going to say we want to forward events to localhost 4242 webhook dot PHP this is the route where our events should be sent now there's going to be two URLs we need to enter this is the one for account events this is for the events that are firing on our own account the second one is for connect events which we're not actually handling today but we'll drop this in there connect is when you're building a Marketplace or a platform for facilitating payment on behalf of other accounts so we've got a new listener set up here so let's open up our terminal and we can see the output for stripe listen down here including the web hook signing secret now every time you create a new webhook endpoint you're going to get a different web hook signing secret this is the secret that you're going to include inside of your web hook construct event call in order to confirm that the payload did in fact come from stripe this prevents people from maliciously attempting to send payloads directly to your webbook endpoint without your permission and sort of maliciously triggering fulfillment so we're going to use this webhook signing secret to confirm that the event came from stripe Now by setting up this listener we now have this direct connection and events will fire on our stripe account and be forwarded to this local machine so what we can do is I'm going to navigate back to the root route and when we hit enter you'll notice that a payment intent is created that's because we're creating that payment intent on the page load for index.php so that we can render the payment element so this is the first event that we are handling is this payment intent created all right so we're going to enter in a card number here CBC and a zip code and hit pay and when we're redirected to the completion page we can see several different events fired on our account including this payment intent dot succeededevent which was forwarded to our server as we are handling the payment intent succeeded event we are logging out that payment was received and we can see that inside of our logs here so we can see that payment was received and if we wanted to this is where we might pull from inventory print shipping labels Mark the customer as booked for some event or call or something so this is how you would actually automate fulfillment again not based on the complete.php but instead using this web hook Handler now another important thing to mention is that when you go to production you won't use the strifer vs code extension or the stripe CLI to forward events instead you'll take your publicly accessible webhook endpoint URL you'll go to the stripe dashboard drop that in so that events are forwarded to your public endpoint you might be wondering how to test out your integration well over in the documentation for accepting a payment you can drill down into the test integration section and for each of the different payment method families between cards wallets Bank redirects Etc there are several different things that will allow you to test different scenarios so for instance we can grab this card this test card that ends in 3155 and we can use that as one of our test cards inside of the payment element and you'll notice that as we go through the payment flow here this will trigger a secure customer authentication payment flow so this is going to pop up a modal and in production this modal would contain a bank account 2fa or sort of like a one-time code or some way to verify that the customer is who they say they are and that they are allowed to authenticate this payment so that's one way that you can test sort of 3D secure and secure customer authentication is with that special card number there's a bunch of different card numbers and test strings that you can use use for different bank accounts so if you're ready to test your integration head over to the docs and look at those test strings another thing worth noting is in the documentation there are some optional steps depending on specific payment method types or QR code based payment methods these might require that you pass additional details when creating the payment intent or they might have other considerations like with Apple pay you'll need to go into the dashboard and make sure that you have an Apple pay domain set up and verified so just to review the entire flow the customer lands on the page and we use any information from that page to create a payment intent using the API and then when we return that payment intents client secret to the client we use that to build out a payment element on our custom form that's where customers enter their billing details and then we can submit that payment directly to stripe client side and then the customer is redirected to a return URL where we display this return status or this success status completion status and finally we're handling fulfillment with our web hook that's where we're actually pulling from inventory and printing shipping labels and doing all those things that we might do when someone buys something from us thank you so much for watching and we'll see in the next one\", metadata={'source': 'D_XL3P4MFH4', 'title': 'Accept a payment with the Payment Element using PHP', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 8508, 'thumbnail_url':

been seeing a lot of different options that developers could use to start accepting payments inside of their react native projects well in this video I want to do something a little bit different and I brought my friend Chen here to show us how we could use stripe identity inside of your react native apps so Chad why don't you introduce yourself to everyone really quick and let them know who you are and what you do hi my name is Chen I'm the mobile engineer at stripe identities team stripe identity is a product it's a separated stripe product that provides the merchant to verify the identity of their users so for example if you want to build a delivery app and you want to verify the identity of the people who delivers the goods you can use stripe identity to onboard them so like you said this is a lot more like identity verification and it's not like user management right so it's not like I have a username or a password or logins or anything of this sort this is more of hey I need to verify that this person is actually who they say they are right and you use that by I'm guessing requesting some type of identity document is that correct yes we collect users driver license passport or ID card and we compare them with their selfie and we do some check on our backend to verify if this user is really whoever they claim to be yeah nice all right well I'm guessing you have a demo right like can we switch over with your screen really quick and see what you got yeah sure so here I have loaded a react native app using our react native SDK so stripe identity react native SDK wraps native Android and iOS sdks because we use the native camera and the Machine learning apis on different platforms so here I loaded this in my Android phone and after I click the verify identity button we will start the native Android flow the first screen um is a stripe privacy policy agreement basically the user needs to agree to Grand strike the permission to use users biometric identification information so I click accept and continue here we have three uh select three types of document in here I'll just select ID card now it's scanning the front of my ID card and the scan we're going to scan the back of my ID card so I love how this thing is using like that native camera feature of the of the actual device but I'm kind of curious about why is it that you have to scan both sides of the ID for the verification yeah because the back of the ID has some barcode information that corresponds to the front of the ID we need to collect the both in both image to do a cross check cross reference check to verify those ID is indeed a real ID okay gotcha and after the ID we will also collect the selfie of the user in here just on my face here nice selfie I love it so here we click three images and uh as you can see the first one is probably a little bit a little bit blurry but we use some machine learning model to find the most accurate images and to the users for us into the server for processing now the verification is submitted and is pending once we click complete we return to the react native app and the status as you can see here is flow completed that's the end of the flow I do want to mention that this doesn't mean the verification passed you still need to rely on some web hook to get the verification result so so we've seen how the demo works like could you show us a little bit of the code and like like what do I need to install and how do I get set up like what are the functions and components I need to use inside of my app to make this work yeah sure uh Charlie do you want to introduce this to us yeah so it looks really similar to what we've already seen a lot of with the stripe react native payments SDK um this is just in a separate npm package which is good that way we're not bloating everyone's apps with you know identity functionality if they don't need it and then payments functionality if they don't need it um but yeah so we're pulling in the use stripe identity hook um passing in our fetch options maybe Chen do you want to navigate over to where we're grabbing these fetch options from yeah perfect so kind of similar with payment sheet how we had to make a request to uh our server which was doing kind of the the hard work of creating an ephemeral key for us we're doing something similar here with the identity SDK passing in a session ID an ephemeral key secret and then the last thing is a brand logo now this is actually going to be local on the app on the device and not pulled from the server and this is kind of that rocket rides logo that we saw earlier in the flow um but that's kind of stored uh right there so doing a quick fetch request grabbing all that passing it to our hook um and then we're getting you know three useful pieces of uh functionality out of the hook and that would be the the status variable our present function and then the loading Boolean loading same thing we've seen a couple times uh a Boolean to show you know a spinner or something like that present is kind of the meat of the functionality behind stripe identity so when we call the present function on like you know the user clicking a button or or tapping something uh that's gonna launch that native uh sheet on IOS and Android they'll step through that flow um and you know this status variable is going to be updated you know whether they've started it or completed it um and we can kind of you know take action based on the the status um but yeah it's obviously an asynchronous bow like Chen mentioned so although the status might be flow completed it doesn't necessarily mean the user's identity is who they said they are is that right yeah that's true cool but yeah after I'm guessing after that verification goes now on the back end I'll have some type of server-side process that's listening for the web hook and then then we can make some business decisions based on whatever the status of that hook is is that correct yeah that's true all right well Chen I mean this looks pretty Sim um pretty easy to use and and also if you've been using like our react native SDK so far it looks pretty familiar so for me it doesn't seem like there's a lot of extra work that actually has to happen was to start integrating identity inside of our inside of our react native applications well thank you so much for coming on and showing us this like this is amazing um so definitely appreciate you coming on and and Charlie as always thank you for coming on here um if for all of you that are watching if you're still interested in learning more about react native SDK for stripe and also our react native stripe identity SDK make sure you check out some of the links inside of the description where we'll have

Document(page_content=\"[Music] hi everyone in this video we're going to learn how to start accepting payments with stripe instead of your react native applications I have my good friend Charlie here is going to show us how to do it so Charlie why don't you tell us a little bit about who you are and what do you do yeah um well first of all it's nice to meet everyone uh like Cecil said my name is Charlie I'm a software engineer at stripe and one of my kind of jobs is to maintain our react native Library which essentially uh or our core react native library because we're starting to get a bit more options as react native kind of grows and grows but our core react native library is about exposing all of the same functionality that's currently offered in our native libraries around payments to react native users to make it really easy to accept payments in a in a react native app nice and I know react native supports iOS Android and probably a couple other platforms too but it sounds like I could compile and run on these different you know these different options and be able to accept payments there too which sounds like like a great option yeah and basically our goal is to kind of replicate your web experience since we've seen so many react developers come over to mobile since react native has kind of made it really approachable um while still giving you the same performance uh that a native Library gives you from stripe iOS and stripe Android gotcha well why don't we take a look at your setup and see uh see how we how this thing works yeah we'd love to uh uh all right so here I've just got you know vs code open on the left where I think you know 90 of us do our JavaScript development and then uh an iOS simulator and an Android emulator running over here on the right um what we're gonna do is use stripe react native to kind of accept payments uh let's say for a kilogram of sweet potatoes uh right there in our react native app um and what we're going to do is use something called the payment sheet which kind of gets rid of our need to do any UI development besides one button um so that kind of really Smooths things out and makes it uh super easy for us so uh without further Ado let's kind of hop right in we've got our normal just app functional component here A View a text and our image source of sweet potatoes I'm gonna delete this uh and uncomment our or kind of fleshed out uh app component here and go through exactly what we've added so number one we've got our stripe provider component um this we're importing from stripe react native what it does in the background is initialize stripe uh with our account that we're getting via the publishable key that we're passing in here this is a string that you'll get from stripe and then also our Merchant identifier this is a string that you'll get from Iowa uh from Apple and essentially just allows us to use uh Apple pay really really easily so we've got our stripe provider which is initializing stripe and then within that we put our checkout page right here we've got our button it's just a normal react native button except for our on press uh which is calling by so we can take a look at what buy is doing right up here and it's presenting our payment sheet but before you present your payment sheet you actually have to initialize it and that's kind of where the meat of payment sheet goes so if I scroll up here here you can see we've got our hook right here which we're kind of using as an import statement stripe react native has a whole bunch of hooks that make things really easy so for example here we were using use payment sheet and that exposes three things that we'll find really useful uh an init payment sheet function which does exactly what it sounds initializes our payment sheet our present payment sheet function which again does exactly what it sounds like it does presents our payment sheet and then a loading Boolean this loading Boolean returns true or false based on the payment sheets kind of current state so if it's in the process of opening or closing it'll come back as true it's loading and so that way we can do things in our UI like show a spinner or disable our button which is kind of how we're using it right now but yeah anyways so uh right on you know app render we're calling initialize payment sheet and this is going to call init payment sheet you can see that right here and we're kind of passing in the base options right now uh what's required is a customer ID a customer ephemeral key secret and then a payment intent client secret all three of these you're actually going to be generating on the server side which is pretty typical of all stripe implementations just for security reasons we're grabbing these from our our Local Host server uh right down here um just a normal fetch call I can kind of show that method over here um so yeah we're just initializing the stripe class grabbing our customer in your real life application you'll probably be grabbing your customer by like their email or some other kind of piece of data um but kind of for our example we're just grabbing our first customer here you can see we are generating an ephemeral key and then on the next line we're generating our payment intent this is where you define things like the amount that the payment's going to be for the currency it's in the customer It's associated with and what payment method types that you want them to be able to use this will come back to later uh what's commented out but yeah then we're just kind of responding with those three pieces of data in Json passing them in here to initialize the payment sheet and then if we receive back an error from in a payment sheet we know something went wrong and we can handle it otherwise we're just going to say you know we're ready to collect payments and kind of Unblock or undisable this button and yeah like I said in the Buy on press callback for our button we're just calling present payment sheet checking for an error otherwise we know it was successful so let's see if everything works as it should um you can see we can add our payment method here you know we'll just use Stripes test card add the ZIP code press the pay button and it should go through get a nice little green button there payment was confirmed successfully cool so it worked all right and then we can open it up on Android cool and so you kind of saw it before on the iOS side because I had tested this flow right before recording but what payment sheet does is save our previous credit card to the customer and that way if they you know as you can see here log in on a different device but it's the same customer or even the same device doesn't matter it'll save their payment method so that way the customer doesn't have to like re-enter their credit card every time they use payment sheet um but yeah same thing on Android you can just kind of go through fill in your your ZIP code click pay and there we go confirmed successfully and that's payment sheet basically so let me let me run through this really quickly you install like the stripe react native SDK right so that's inside of your react native project in the back end you created a payment intense and then now in your front end right because we have two applications the front end piece and there's a back-end piece in a front-end piece you're going to make a request over to that backend just to get the payment intent information and again we do this for security reasons for PCI compliance and things of that nature and then now you're going to use that information you got from that payment incent to initialize the the payment sheet right and so now you set it up you give it some configuration information and then now on button click you're gonna say well present payment sheet right and it's going to show us the UI and we're going to kind of go through you know adding you know adding the credit card and the you know the zip code and all the information you need to actually process the payment right yeah that's exactly right and great Point bringing it up um so the actual package is at stripe stripe react native this is on npm so you can download it with yarn or npm kind of whatever you use um yeah but then other than that you just have your your server side which if you're collecting payments on the web you probably already have up and running and you just plug your react native uh app into that and it should work essentially the same okay so then when I think about like building react apps that run on the web and I'm using something like strap checkout sometimes what happens is that like if I want to enable um a new payment method or something like that I can just go in the dashboard and I could you know hit the little check box right and turn it on and then it'll just it'll just you know materialize on the page for me is that the same thing with with this like can I just you know add additional payment methods without having to you know redo a bunch of code or redeploy my app and and now I'll just have those options available for me whenever the the payment sheet shows up yeah exactly that's so that's a really good question adding payment methods is really simple with the payment sheet there's actually two different cases we can think of so the first is exactly what you're talking about payment methods like you would in stripe checkout so something like paying with a US bank account um the other one is you know your native wallets like Apple and Google pay so Apple and Google pay you do need to make a client-side change which is very simple it's basically just passing in a configuration object for each of those to finish initialized payments fee or init payment sheet so here we just are passing in you know Apple pay Google pay with some params that each require we'll save that uh and you know let's just reload our app over in the terminal and now we should see you know Apple pay presented as an option right here nice and then we can click Apple pay uh and do that and Google pay essentially functions the exact same way um but then what you're talking about adding a new payment method that's you know not a card at all maybe it's a US bank account maybe it's a firm maybe it's after pay so what we're going to do to do that is navigate over here to our our server side and when we're creating our payment intent we're passing in this like payment method types array before we just had card um but now we're passing in you know what is this five different payment methods we'll save that and reload our server wait for this button to initialize again Perfect all right there we go uh and if we click buy now add a new payment method we can see payment sheet now displays all these new payment methods that we just added on the server side without making any changes to the app or anything like that so let's say you want to start accepting uh ideal payments or something like that you can just update your server not have to kind of deploy through apple and Google's App Store review process you kind of just start collecting this new payment method with with very little code essentially one line of code yeah and I love how easy that is and I think about you know as we try to reach customers you know from from different parts of the world that don't only use credit cards but again you might want to use clarner or after pay or use your bank account instead of giving your credit card number so it really is just talking about giving our users the option to choose how they want to pay right and even when they want to pay when you think about things like clan on afterpay that break them up into little pieces so I think having this this level of customization built into the SDK and and seeing how easy it is for us to do these things with react native is amazing yeah exactly and especially me you know when I kind of came at stripe and arrived here I was in that headspace of thinking oh I bet the whole world uses credit cards and then you know after one week here I learned that credit cards is a a very different thing worldwide and some places rely on totally different methods of payment um and so this just helps you reach a global audience of customers rather than the customer customers with the payment methods you inherently assume they're using gotcha this is great well hey Charlie thank you so much I really appreciate you coming on and showing us those demos and thank you all for watching if you're interested in learning about more how you can integrate stripe inside of your act native applications stay tuned because we're going to have more videos and also if you're interested in this particular demo uh check out the link in the description below or even in the link that's showing on the screen right now and you'll be able to go over there and download the code and try it on your own missions but

Document(page_content=\"starting to collect recurring payments with stripe checkout is the next step and now that we have an authenticated user and we have a pricing page that's going to give us the ID of a price we're ready to go checkout is a page that's hosted by stripe where we're going to redirect customers they will fill out some payment information that'll start a subscription and they'll ultimately be redirected back to our application using stripe checkout is the recommended way to collect recurring payments for your SAS business this integration includes one API call to create this thing called a checkout session that'll have a URL property on it that we're going to redirect customers to I know there's a lot of arguments there but I definitely recommend going through the API reference for creating a checkout session and looking at every single possible argument and depending on your business you may want to enable some or disable others so go ahead and take a look at the documentation for creating checkout sessions [Music] recall that we have a pricing page here but when we click on the button to start the subscription we're redirected to slash checkout and we haven't actually implemented this in the query stream parameters we have a price ID and that is going to be the ID of the price for the related tier subscription the recurring interval the currency and the amount that we want to subscribe to we're going to take that price ID and create a checkout session within let's create a new controller called checkouts inside of our checkouts controller we're going to add a new action inside of a show which will create the checkout session and redirect us before we Implement that we want to make sure that we have an authenticated user on this page before we let them do anything so we're going to re have a B4 action authenticate user now inside of the show action we're going to create a checkout session now you can create one directly using the stripe ruby gem with stripe check out sessions.create session ular.create and passing in all of your different arguments including the mode of subscription and a customer ID like this now if you've stored the customer ID in your own database and you're you're manually building an integration this is the way that you would want to go because we're using the page M here we can say current user dot payment processor dot checkout we're going to pass along the mode as subscription and line items are going to be simply params price ID that's going to create a checkout session object with all of the sensible defaults we will redirect to the checkout sessions URL we need to allow other hosts because when we're using stripe checkout we're going to be redirected to checkout.stripe.com we also are going to set the status to see other now when we're using pay this is really all that we need to get started so we need to add a route here for resource checkout now when we make that get request we're redirected to the checkout page we can either use our link authenticated payment method which is pre-populated here because we're logged in with this uh this existing user or we could use another payment method in this case we could use a U.S bank account that will debit our bank account 28 every single month now when we click subscribe we are ultimately redirected back to our application notice that in the query string we have access to the ID of that checkout session if we wanted to we could display things or information about the checkout session here we could also customize where the customer is redirected back to now the most important thing is that we actually provision access and give someone access once they have paid and subscribed that we're going to do in another episode before we get there though I wanted to talk about a couple different things the first of which is inside of our checkout sessions controller or inside of our checkouts controller although this is the simplest way to do it and this is the way that we recommend using pay the pay gem to create a checkout session you could also create a checkout session directly using stripe rubygem by saying stripe check out sessions.session.create and then passing in all of your own arguments in which case we do need to include a customer object pay is going to include that for us by default but here we would need to say something like current user dot payment processor dot processor ID but in order to use that processor ID we first need to Cache the user object and make sure that we have a customer so we're going to say current user.payment processor Dot customer now again this is only required if we're going to use stripe Ruby directly all right so line items by default are a list of items and we're going to pass in the price and a quantity if you wanted to have a per seat model where customers paid per user on their account for instance then you might want to use this quantity to control how many seats they've purchased in our case we're only going to limit it to one seat you can also make this adjustable inside of stripe checkout using adjustable quantity when we create a checkout session we also need to pass a success URL and a cancel URL the success URL defines where the customer will be redirected after they've successfully subscribed the cancel URL is where we're going to send the customer if they bail out and say return to your application all right let's take this for a spin by going back to our pricing page and this time we'll go for the 32 dollar a month subscription level we're redirected to checkout again now we see this 32 dollars per month there's a lot of different things that we can enable with stripe checkout for instance we might want to enable automatic tax calculation so we could say automatic tax enabled true now if we want to enable automatic taxes we also need to enable customer address updating so if we go back let me show you what I mean so if we go back to localhost and we go through the the payment flow here and we're redirected to checkout we're going to see an error that says automatic tax calculation requires a valid address so we either need to update the customer object with an address or we need to allow the customer's address to be updated so we're gonna let's add this argument to our checkout session create call so that we can update the customer's address so we'll go through this checkout flow again customer update address Auto now we can see that sales tax is being calculated as part of the checkout process that's pretty neat another feature of checkout that I find very handy is being able to pass through some metadata so we can pass metadata at the top level here and specify that the user ID that this checkout session is for is our current user.id we can also set some metadata on the subscription so we can say subscription data has some metadata for the user ID again being the current user's ID since we're using the page M pay is going to handle a lot of the web hook work for us so we won't actually have to worry about this too much as a pro tip if you're implementing this without pay I'd highly recommend attaching the metadata with reference to the current user both at the checkout session level and the subscription level let's take a look at one other thing we can do we can enable promotion codes with allow promotion [Music] codes true now if we were to go back through checkout this time let's try out our Enterprise tier we'll see that we can enter in a promotion code if we happen to have one and click apply and now we have 20 off so that's pretty neat again there's a number of different options for creating a checkout session this might look a little bit daunting but really it's just configuring the the experience that your customers have when they redirect through checkout let's say we want to continue through with this subscription and we click subscribe now when we're redirected to the landing page we don't have any indication that the customer is actually subscribed and if we attempt to access the dashboard in fact we're redirected back to the pricing page so how do we know if the customer is actually subscribed great question and that's something that we're going to answer in the next episode when we talk about provisioning and we're going to talk about setting up your web hook events in your web hook forwarding thanks so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one\", metadata={'source': 'pTtJjOKLYsQ', 'title': 'SaaS

and enterprise and each of those have both a monthly price and an annual price in this episode i want to talk about a more advanced feature of the api that is that is api only as of this recording and that is lookup keys so each price object has a property called a lookup key the lookup key comes in handy when we're trying to build a really dynamic pricing page that allows us to test out different prices now by default we might only have one monthly price for a given product that we want to display on our pricing page however if we want to test out our pricing so for instance if we wanted to change our price from 24 a month to 28 a month and see how that performed rather than needing to deploy new code that referenced those certain price objects what we could do is use a lookup key and have the same lookup key on the old price and transfer that to the new price so let's take a look at what i'm talking about so here we have a six prices we're using the stripe shell here to list out the prices so we're saying stripe prices list this gives us all of our different price objects so within here we have one price that is twenty four dollars and that is underneath the uh the start up here so if for instance what one thing that we could do is copy the id of the monthly price that is this this price here and say that we want to update this so stripe prices update pass in the id of that price and give it a look up key of startup this is going to set the lookup key on the price to start up now every single price in your stripe account has to have a either a nil lookup key or a unique lookup key so this lookup key is going to be unique across your stripe account what's cool is that what we can do now is say stripe prices list and we can ask for only the lookup only the prices that have the lookup keys of startup that will return just this single price that is the startup price now you can start to imagine maybe you already have the idea or an inkling about how you might build a pricing page where you say just give me the prices where the lookup keys are startup or business or enterprise and that would give you back just the prices that you need what's really cool is there is another argument to the api when you're when you're creating prices is to create a brand new price and transfer the lookup key from the old price to the new to a new price so let's say we wanted to say um let's say we wanted to test out some pricing for a new pricing level for this given product so we're going to create another monthly price we're going to try increasing the price and see how that performs in the market so we're going to say stripe prices create for the product that we already have the um the unit amount this time is going to be 28 and the currency is going to be the same recurring interval is going to be month tax behavior is exclusive still but now we can say look up key we want the lookup key for this new price to be stirred up and we can say transfer lookup key true what that will do is it will move the lookup key called startup from the old price to the new price now when we say stripe prices list for startup as our lookup key the price that we're getting back is at the 28 amount so we just created a brand new price and moved the lookup key from the old price to the new price that's really powerful because when we build our pricing page later we want to do it based on lookup keys again this is an api only feature so we need to use the api or the stripe cli or this stripe shell here in order to work with and modify those lookup keys on price objects this is something that we hope to add to the dashboard uh soon but for now this is api only so that is how you use lookup keys they're very powerful and i would say it's a bit of a more advanced feature not necessarily required for bus for modeling your business it can be very handy if you're going to build your own pricing page all right thanks so much for watching and we'll

everyone's here right so why don't we go ahead and get started so we are officially live welcome everyone to stripe dev live um this might be a little bit different from some of the other ones we've done before if you've been on distracted live before generally we usually do these on discord but we said hey why not try something new and different and try it on the twitter space so if you all like this type of format if you think this is pretty cool we should do more of these let us know after this conversation and we can definitely talk about that but uh today i'm really excited about this conversation because i think we're going to be talking about something that's very near and dear to a lot of us and and something that has like a lot of deep emotional roots and our panel today is a group of amazing developer advocates across a lot of different companies and they're going to be talking this about some of the struggles that they've experienced and are even still going through as they're doing their day-to-day job and so i want to start off with really quickly i'm just going to call everyone to have them introduce themselves and then uh and then we'll dive into our conversation so james why don't we start with you yeah what's going on everyone um i from a developer advocate perspective i'm a developer advocate at a company called planetscale before that i was a developer advocate at alzero and then i actually started my career as a technical evangelist which is a more a little bit older term for basically the same type of thing at microsoft and i usually talk about three things that i do i'm a developer speaker and teacher and i've done some combination of those things professionally for about 10 years now awesome thank you james i appreciate you being here and brian clark hey everyone thanks for having me and uh my name is brian clark i'm a developer advocate at sneak uh prior to that i was at microsoft and then i was at disney as a engineering role before that and uh yeah happy to talk about the struggles of being a developer advocate awesome uh rozelle what about you you want to go next yeah sure uh hey everyone my name is rozelle i'm a developer advocate at github i'm pretty new to developer advocacy i've been uh here for like about 10 months before that i was a software engineer at like random startups that no one's ever heard of um and like everybody else i'm super excited to like just rant about the struggles of being a developer advocate oh i believe there will be a lot of ranting happening today that's for sure um jay why don't you go next one yeah sure um hey i'm jay miller i'm a senior cloud out there at microsoft before that i was a developer advocate of elastic and i've been in the industry for a couple of years but before that i was creating content mostly podcasting for about i think it's been eight years now so well aware of the industry but didn't know how to get in until a few years ago and uh happy to talk about that as well as some other struggles awesome and i guess i'll jump into like so my name is cecil phil for folks that may not know me um i'm also a developer advocate i've been in the industry for about 13 years and spent i want to say like the last five of those in advocacy you know working with developers and you know creating content and things of that nature and you know one of the things that i love about this panel of folks that we have is that i feel like everyone has a completely different level of experience in terms of like how they do their job how they got into advocacy in the first place and how they can think about like advocacy as a discipline within like the developer community too so i'm really interested in hearing what these folks have to say and also to folks that are listening um definitely feel free to go ahead and ask questions raise your hand we'll try and get you in and get some of your questions answered as we we have this uh this discussion so i want to start off with this question um because i think this is kind of kind of lead into some of the other things that we want to talk about and that is what does advocacy mean to you like what is what does developer advocacy actually mean and and why don't we start off with you like i'd love to hear what your take is on that question okay cool uh i guess advocacy means to me um just empowering developers as they use your product like i want to make sure as a as a developer advocate that people are not confused on how to use the product that they feel excited to use the product um and that it's just enabling them to do what they need to do what they do best which is their job um yeah i think to me that's that's developer advocacy listening to the the user making sure and the user being the developer making sure that they can they can succeed as developers nice and brian what about you i'd love to hear about what you think advocacy is and even to what what made you decide to get into advocacy in the first place oh you're gonna hit me with the double question now huh well i gotta give you extra work to do because you know i know i know you can handle it uh no i think razell hit it uh spot on um and yeah like the only thing i would i guess add to that is you know part of being a developer advocate to me is being able to be your authentic self and everything that not necessarily have to um because at times depending on who you're collaborating with at your your company maybe they're in sales or or whatever they they're gonna want you to approach things a certain way and you have to kind of push back and be like well that's not how i would share these things with developers or i don't believe that that would be of interest to a developer and so forth so being authentic and uh organic approaching things organically and not forcing things is uh the one little thing i would add to what what roselle already talked upon and then what was that second question again how did i get into devrel or developer what made you decide to get into it yeah so i mean as i was uh doing more engineering related when i was in my engineering role um i really just found myself enjoying um learning new things and then sharing what i learned with other colleagues so it started small with like just certain people on my immediate team like maybe a close friend that i made on my team and like saying hey this is cool thing i learned about and then that slowly expanded to doing more like luncheon learns and then like doing my first time speaking at an internal conference and i found myself just gravitating more and more towards activities like that and then an opportunity arose where i could get paid for that i was like heck yeah i'm gonna jump in on that opportunity i mean i was totally happy and i i foresaw myself you know living the rest of my life in that engineering role even at that original company um but i i saw it as like this is i need to challenge myself maybe and like see and pursue this further since i'm already feeling find myself gravitating towards those things and uh and that's where that's what led me to to where i'm at now you know what some of my friends some of my non-technical friends ask me what i do for a living i like to tell them i'm a i'm a teacher that teaches developers how to do stuff right um because i kind of look at developer advocacy as as an education first kind of role you know and it's education on both sides right we have to educate the company as to what developers need and what what the temperature of the room can is and but then also too we have to educate our our communities about again these products and practices and those types of things that you know we're obviously doing for the different companies right the other do you all agree with that do you think that makes sense i think there was a tweet a while back it was like maybe it was you actually that sent that to it was like what's going to happen in 20 years when all these developer advocates decide you know what i think i'm done with tech uh i think someone was like oh man high school teaching is is probably the night that's like the retirement career path for us and honestly i feel it like some of the most fun that i've had in this role is speaking to students speaking to college students even speaking to high school students and for me that was because i didn't know what i'm doing today was a job when i was their age so i want to have opportunities to expose them to those types of careers because one right now i think kids these days are just giving all of the the world of social media and things around them and how they navigate it and how they navigate it so fluently i think that it puts them in such an advantageous position for the future of devrel but that being said no one's talking about that you know on career day at high school in high school so for me i love the idea of teaching but i also love the idea of exposing new career opportunities and ideas to that next generation yeah i agree with that 100 percent uh it looks like crystals looks like i'm going to try and get you on uh i think crystals has a question this is not working for me while you're doing i wanted to add really quickly on the the concept of people not knowing that devrel developer relations by the way so there's developer advocate as a job developer relations is usually a team but denver being an opportunity that people don't know about and this is 100 of the truth for me coming out of college i applied for microsoft for a regular software development job that i didn't get applied for another role didn't get it and then they were like what do you think about uh technical evangelist i was like i don't know but this is microsoft so sure and that's like it's really sad but the reality is that's where the majority of the jobs are it's just like traditional software engineering but devrella's growing more and more and people are seeing more about what develop can do and they're getting hired on earlier at companies and so i think that visibility of this being an option is continuing to grow which is really exciting yeah i agree with you crystals i think you're online did you have a question you wanted to ask the folks yep hey guys um i've been a developer advocate for three years officially and unofficially for eight years uh it's probably one of the most fun and exciting jobs in anyone's tech career so if you get a chance to do it i would say for most people that have done developer advocacy how do you find rewards and getting recognized for the work that you do because advocating to developers is fantastic especially when you have a large audience but how do you take that and make it measurable so you can go back to your manager and show the impact yeah i agree with you and and i think that's a good segue right like let's let's kind of start diving into what some of these struggles that we do have as developers developer advocates are um i know this actually kind of started with an article that james wrote james quick wrote an article called top five struggles of the developer advocate and you know we had a conversation and we thought this would be a really great twitter space because i'm sure there's tons of folks that are in advocacy or trying to get into advocacy that would love to you know hear what other people's experiences are and you know kind of like what christos mentioned like one of the big things that i think all of us experienced as advocates is trying to figure out well how do we measure success right like how do we know that we're doing a good job how do we know that we're doing the right job and and not only how do we know that we're doing a good job but how do we let our you know our leadership team know that we're doing a good job as well um and so james why don't i pass it to you and maybe you could talk about that for a little bit yeah i'll do a slightly different take so i think like especially in the article that roselle wrote after mine she touched on like the metrics are tough and i think that's a consistent theme so i'm sure everyone will have more to talk about there but i also want to talk about the like raising awareness for what you're doing and this is something that i've significantly struggled with in my career and especially my time at microsoft where it was my first job out of college and i felt like i was doing as impactful of events and activities as anyone else especially with my level of experience and for the first year that worked really well second year i didn't get it's not the recognition for like making me feel good it was like end of year reviews didn't match up with what i thought i had done like the level that i thought i performed at and i realized that people around me that were getting more recognition and just people were more aware of their activities were more comfortable talking about themselves and at the time like i was kind of turned off by this idea because i was like i don't feel like like i don't i don't need to talk about myself all the time that's just not naturally who i am but that also is part of in any career but especially in denver is being able to craft that story about the impact that you have and we can get into like what metrics do you track specifically and all those things but oftentimes it comes down to like how well can you tell the story of the impact and some of that is like i had a one-on-one conversation with an individual developer and they went on to do this that's like that's as impactful as speaking to a room full of 100 people at a conference or it can be depending on how you phrase it so i think a lot of us feel really uncomfortable not bragging but like we feel like we're bragging by talking about ourselves and our accomplishments and i think one of the things that you kind of have to step outside of or kind of have to force yourself to be a little uncomfortable is just becoming more comfortable talking about yourself because otherwise like it's the tree falls in the forest doesn't make a sound type thing if no one's around like you're not no one's gonna know unless you tell that story story so the further you progress in your career hopefully you can push yourself to be a little bit more comfortable to take control of that narrative and feel more comfortable sharing your story with people and do that in a way that hopefully to other people into yourself doesn't feel like you're going out of your way to brag about the work that you're doing yeah brian you got your handle yeah i just i felt really strongly about what james just shared and i i i don't know i tend to over index onto the side of um you know being i have a strong aversion towards talking highly of myself in general and i over index on that a bit but i've quickly learned a hard lesson from this because i was of the mentality that like my work will speak for itself and i should just naturally get recognized for that work because like i don't i don't i shouldn't have to need to talk about it right that just people should be good about that but the reality is like your your leader is they have their own responsibilities and they're busy with their own things at times and while they would love to be able to see everything that you do and all the impact you have you have to make note of it and bring that up and shed light on it because it's just not really possible for somebody so it still feels awkward to me and i'm actively working on getting better about doing that um but i've quickly learned especially in this role that it's it's a necessity yeah i definitely agree with what both of you all said um i know prior to prior to me being like a professional advocate and i used to do a podcast then one of the things i hated in that podcast was i hated having to listen to myself which is kind of work right considering that you're doing a podcast but even that to say like oh wow i you know we did a really good job of this interview or we did a really good job at interviewing this person like i refused to listen to it after the recording was done because i'm like i was there i know what happened i'm done i'm gonna walk away from it because it gives me like this level of anxiety you know and i'm sure a lot of us that probably do videos and do other forms of media probably feel the same way too right because this job is such a public facing job and then sometimes like that emotion and that anxiety kind of gets to us and we're like i hope people like it but i also i'm a little afraid to hear what the response is going to be like you know what i mean and so we kind of have to try and balance those emotions a little bit as we're trying to figure out well you know how can i best do my job right and how can i best achieve what i'm trying to do uh resolving your hands up i'm gonna let you jump in yeah i actually have a question um because y'all are more experienced than me but first i want i have like a little context so like i'm similar to what you're saying cecil like i i'm i'm kind of more of a shy person and i didn't even really consider developer advocacy until i started um teaching other women of color and i was like oh wait this is kind of cool i thought i'd be more scared of like speaking in front of people but i like it and i'm the same where i don't really want to re-listen to myself because my voice doesn't sound anything like what i thought it was um but my question to y'all is like how do you tastefully or like in a good way keep telling people about the work you're doing because i feel like i'm annoying like i feel like i'm posting in slacks posting in twitter i'm like hey i mean more content and i don't want to like um clog up everybody's feed but i still want people to be able to recognize my work so that i'd be able to advance in my career yeah i'll jump in real quick and then i'll let let some of our panel folks um talk about it but the way that i approach the job is i try to i try to put authenticity first in front of everything else and when i say that i mean hey if i if i really like this product or if i really like this programming language or this thing that i'm working on like i want to generally show my learning experience as i'm going through it if that makes sense versus oh hey i'm just like i'm not a ruby person i'm going to start posting in like ruby forms i'm not a you know typescript person whether i'm going to start posting typescript forms but hey i'm generally interested in learning about i don't know maybe serverless and microservices and so now i really want to in in you know and um embed myself in those communities and not just be there to to to give stuff but also receive as well right like it has to be like a symbiotic relationship that you know i'm learning from the community and they're learning from me as well and now we can kind of share a little bit and that for me makes me feel a little bit more authentic when i do it versus me being like oh hey we're doing a thing today or there's a particular event that happens i you know i drop a tweet or post and i disappear and then you know we move on to the next thing uh jay i see you get your hand up um i i wanna you know echo some of the thoughts that brazil had um the the live experience for a lot of you know black kids with anxiety growing up is often i'm not worth listening to and the things that i have to say aren't valid and that is something that i struggle with to this day like i i think probably one of the things that most of us on this panel have had are people have come to us and said like hey i love what you're doing and the the feeling there is often but what am i doing like what what what am i doing that makes me feel so [Music] valuable to you if you're you know an employer or to the community and you know we talk when james is talking about the idea of you know sharing those things and there's always talking about almost feeling as if you were annoying people uh with the idea of let me share everything let me tell everybody everything that i'm doing i think sometimes we have to do that for ourselves as well to show like oh wait no i am out here actually doing something i am out here making a commitment to you know this community but i'm also like working with my company as well like i'm showing value to my company but i'm also showing value to the community at the same time because when we don't see that when we don't see that value we immediately start getting into our head as you know james's first line in his blog post of like anxiety is real and like am i doing a good job if we don't have that validation in that feedback loop we don't think we are and i think a lot of that comes from the anxiety of doing this job but also some of the lived anxieties that we have just growing up yeah i love the i mean i love the honesty and transparency all the way around because this is i feel like deborah has always been our developer advocate has always been one of those positions that like seems celebrity like just because it's like usually a person that you see on youtube or at a conference or whatever um so i appreciate this whole thing but the one one thing i'll add that has just been like somewhat devrel specific and mainly just life is like typically we will always be the ones that fail to recognize our own value and some of that is just like based on a lot of different experiences some of that is just not taking the time to actually think about the impact that we have and my wife and i talk about this a lot like someone someone will come up to us similar to what you said jay and say like oh so impressive that you did x y or z whatever it is and we're like well that's just like that's part of my job but the reality is like develops a very specific set of skills that is not very common like this idea of being social enough being able to create content being able to get up in front of an audience and talk being able to do that from a technical perspective where you don't lose trust and you earn people's respect it's a really really tough set of skills and like if you're in that position there's already something there and one of the things i encourage people to do including myself like all the advice that i give other people and stuff that i continually try to work on is take that time out to think about what it is that you've done and what you've accomplished and why that's valuable because we often overlook it and the sharing aspects like the and the lack of validation the one one other thing i'll add is just to try to have open conversations with manager and peers uh to say like do you think i'm sharing enough do you think i'm sharing too much do you think i'm doing a good job like don't be afraid to ask for that feedback and use that as something that you can act on yeah i think that's a really good point and one thing i would love to add to that is you know for a lot of us you know a lot of us have way different experiences you know in terms of tenure and even companies that we've worked for and sometimes we can be in a position where like we ask for feedback internally and like we just don't get it right or you know we don't we don't we don't get like the detail of information that we needed to know whether we're doing a good job or not and then that also can cause a lot of anxiety right like when you're not getting from your leadership like the communication right and like the clear instructions about what exactly is expected of you or how well you're doing then that too could give you like a sense of like uncertainty and so for me like whenever that's happened in the past like i look out to my community right like usually the community or folks in other departments whatever would say hey you're doing a good job this was really helpful you know this this made me feel um way better because it made me feel like i'm not wasting my time just like doing random things for for what for what point you know what i mean um and i think that too also kind of leads into another conversation that i i kind of want us to dive into and inside of advocacy like we all have a tons of different like responsibilities and different things to focus on like how do you choose what you focus on like how do you choose this is the thing right now that we're gonna put our time in and why don't i start with jay jay i see you get your hand up man so why don't you you take that question first i i want to say uh i don't choose things they choose me um and i i mean that in almost full honesty of having adhd and just understanding that i will go down certain paths and sometimes the answer is just you gotta go down that path until you hit a dead end and go somewhere else um it it really does feel that way at times and i think that that is that is a struggle um you know i i think i tweeted about this the other week like one of my favorite lines uh in any really long monologue on a record is the last lines of camp from donald lover and he talks about like i got on the bus a boy and i never got off the bus and and then like the start of the next album is talking about sometimes you just gotta get off the bus so that that to me is very much the feeling of like i will find something and it will just it will just crawl into my brain and i'll be thinking about it all day i'm like i i got it i gotta chase this itch i gotta figure it out um hopefully like i think the way that you can usually help to off ramp that is like open communication i think a lot of the answers here are going to be open communication talk talk to your bosses talk to your colleagues like does anybody else have this problem is it okay if i it's okay if i go down this road for a little bit and then from there like once once it's been co-signed on you're like cool all right let's let's dive into this let's build this let's make it work you know jay and i were just talking really quickly and i was asking the question you know what happens when you get assigned to do like a job or project or you know work on a product you know from an advocacy perspective but you're just you're just not interested in it right like you don't have the passion or you know you're not you know you're not interested in learning that topic right like what do you do and i'm going to jump into like jay you were talking about it right so do you want to chime in really quick uh only if i can share some advice that i got from my big brother in the industry a guy named cecil phillips you know i one of the things that i love about the industry is we have there's a lot of mentorship that happens and being able to have conversations with people and have open conversations and be like yo i'm really struggling with this right now and uh the advice that i got was sometimes you just gotta burn through it like make the thing get the thing done um invite people to collaborate to make it better i definitely will always say like it's it's so much easier to uh bear with the process if you have other people bearing with you versus you trying to take it all on your own but i i think that tech in general is so flexible that we often can find a way to to make even some of the most just dry topics interesting and i think that's like you have to in sometimes find a way to say oh this thing is kind of dry kind of boring but what if we what if we took a new spin on what if we remixed it and and turned it into something that looks at a traditionally dry topic with a little bit more uh interesting flavor to it so result i know you're you're like the freshest advocate out of the panel that's here what is what has that experience been like for you like choosing what products to work on or being told what products to work out and then having to you know find the energy and the motivation to do things that sometimes you don't want to do yeah i mean i'm a pretty ex like you can get me excited about like anything you can be like you have to write about something really boring and i'll be like yeah let's do it um especially when i first started um in developer advocacy just because i was just so excited that i had this job i was like oh my gosh i'm like excited and ready to do everything um so like i essentially tried out different media formats different topics and like that helped me to figure out the things i don't like to do like for example my team is like really big on like creating youtube shorts and tick tocks and i'm i'm just like not i don't like doing it um it's not fun for me um so what i ended up doing like i tried it out um and i just kind of told brian like i don't like doing this as much um and he was like that's fine especially because i found different ways to show my value like my team wasn't creating as many blog posts as me so i would just like put out mad blog posts and it's like okay that's okay because like you're offsetting it with that and then if there's like topics i don't really like as much i usually try to think of like how would i have made this exciting for myself like if i was the learner and that makes me like more engaged and interested while i'm like creating that content or learning that topic um but there are times where like i for example i know like co-pilot's a little bit of a a controversial topic i don't really um always want to to talk about certain topics like that um but i'm i'm trying to find ways to do it in a way that's like less controversial or um changes their perspective a little bit so yeah that i kind of rambled but those are my thoughts no that totally makes sense james you got your hand up yeah i love that um one interesting thing about me in the full transparency i've gotten the feedback before which i think is completely appropriate that like if it's not something that i already believe in that i kind of shut it down too fast so this is from sam gillin who's uh director of denver law zero and i shout him out because this is like really valuable piece of feedback and i think it's definitely true it's something i have to balance with but i also have this perspective of like as much as possible why would i spend time doing something if it's not something that i'm excited about now there's obviously a balance right like you have to do things sometimes that you're not excited about but i think everyone's first approach should be like either how can i do less of the thing that i'm not excited about or something kind of similar to what's been said like how do i turn this thing into something that i am more excited about and i had a conversation recently with my current vp of like talking about transitioning some of the content that we're doing and me just being honest i was like i i don't know if one that's not something i'm excited about but also i don't know that i think that's the best use of my time for these reasons and i'm kind of curious like i still think there's probably a little bit more of a conversation for us to have on that and i definitely had to fight that balance of pushing back too early while also considering like this is an opportunity for myself to do something different um but the the output of that is like just by having the conversation and being honest and giving a reason for why i think something else would be a better use of my time um being able to basically run with that idea instead while also keeping in mind like i have this thing that i would rather do but also having to translate that back to the reason that you wanted me to do this other thing the thing we were trying to accomplish or do better at i think i can push that needle cliche thing but i think i can impact that thing better by doing it this way so i think just having the conversation always starting with an approach of like things that we do should be fun i i have worked with plenty of people who just accept that everything in the world sucks and that's the way it's going to be and that's not the kind of person that i want to be but there is that balance of like making sure that you're being a team player that you're open to ideas and then uh figuring out what the best way to capitalize on that is yeah i i totally agree with you like it's always about a good balance right and for folks that are listening like we definitely don't want to make it sound like oh developer advocates or a bunch of divas that only want to work on stuff they want to work on but i think there's also the point that a part of our job is to get our communities and other developers and industry excited about the things that you know that we're showing it right like whether we're talking about like a new programming language feature a cloud thing or i don't know whatever whatever product it is we're working on like our job is to get you excited about it and if we're not excited about it it's very hard to be you know not our authentic selves to go out and kind of push that right like that's you know that's very disingenuous right and so that's why it's important for us to believe in the things that we're talking about because if we truly believe it then you know you'll see the authenticity in our videos and our content and the things that we create and it won't feel like a forced process uh brian i see you guys your hand up yeah i don't have much more to add because you all hit on the things that were going through my mind balance being team player uh the one thing i wanted to add about uh you know choosing what what you like to work on versus what you don't like to work on i think whether you're dev advocate or you're an engineer you're in any career as you kind of progress on you start learning more about yourself and what you enjoy doing and not to get all you know like philosophical or anything like that but like you you know you only have so much time in your life and your job that you're doing so you want to spend and capitalize as much time of that doing the things you enjoyed doing um and so i think that's the the the driver behind a lot of this at times but again all this stuff that you all said already plays into it too so it's just it's not necessarily doing that 100 of the time it's balancing and and supporting team players like the biggest thing that comes to mind to me is like i will suck it up and just do what needs to be done because we want to win the game we want to have the impact on developers in our company so uh yeah yeah for sure and uh jesse i saw you we uh we just uh let you in man so you had a question or something you wanted to add to the conversation yeah i just wanted to add in a super cool conversation here by the way uh but one of the topics too about for develop developer advocacy is a great question is why am i not excited about that so when there are these really dry topics i mean listicles are still listicles at the end of the day but like if there's a topic where you're like man i just can't get behind this um that's totally an opportunity too to actually look into it and say um yeah like what is i don't understand about this and why it's meaningful for the space that i'm in and maybe it's an opportunity to learn and actually you know stretch out into a new category with a question kind of playing off of that one of the things that i feel as a driver in our careers is the ability to communicate and i guess i don't want to say influence but like speak to other advocates about being an advocate and i'm not gonna lie like i love these conversations because it talks about like the hard part i don't like trying to tell other people how to do what they're doing because honestly you do you has gotten me pretty far in life but i i want to pose that question as kind of uh like how do you find excitement to do that thing that is like a career mover like most of us like we network with each other i think everyone here um on the panel is either currently or has currently worked in a company you know at the same company uh maybe in different times so it shows that it's a small world and people knowing each other is a thing but how do you find the excitement doing to just engage with one another professionally like is just that you know the i call the ice cream parlor because not everybody goes to the bar there's like just congregating at the ice cream collar or you know grabbing dinner after a conference or whatever just connecting with each other on a space is that enough and if it's not how do you push yourself over the edge to do more yeah that's a really good question um i can tell you for me like people excite me right like being able to learn from other people and and so come knowledge from them for me is always really exciting so sometimes you know i'll be in a position where i'll give an example like in a past life i used to work on a product that dealt with taxes i'll be honest with you taxes isn't the most riveting thing to talk about at least not for me but at the time i did have the opportunity to create and work on some software that i thought was really interesting so like the technology was interesting to me and how we were solving the problem was interesting to me you know what i mean the problem itself wasn't that interesting but like how we saw that was interesting and so i'm bringing it up because sometimes you have to find angles around to get the job done you know what i mean like so i don't know maybe you don't care about metrics or maybe you don't care about like you know open telemetry or ai or whatever the case is but hey i do might get the opportunity to work with some cool people i might get the opportunity to get some new skills i might get the opportunity to get in front of a different audience of people that i haven't done before and that might be the interesting part about it and maybe that's how you can find that motivation uh rosella so you got your hand up yeah i will say i agree with you cecil i'm like there's there's two parts for me like one i try to find different angles a lot like i worked at an insurance tech company um as a software engineer that that sounds hella boring but like we had hackathons and that would be when we would come up with ideas of what else we could add to our product and like one of my ideas was like adding a translation feature so that like people who didn't speak um native um natively speak english could um use the app like that type of stuff made me excited because i'm excited to help people so like i always think of it that way like oh i'm even though i'm not that interested in this i'm excited to help someone like be able to use this because i just i don't know i just like helping people and then on the like more the less the less like self-less side i'm also pretty competitive and i want to be the best so like i will if there's some topic that i don't like i'll be like it's okay because i'm trying to i'm trying to be the best developer advocate so even if this is like something boring or hard i know it's going to make me improve as a developer advocate um and i approach like software engineering like the same way yeah i love it i love that competitive energy man 100 um james i see you got your hand up and then after james um indra asked to speak so after you we're gonna have him um go ahead and ask this question cool uh one thing i just realized is roselle is the one who obviously cut twitter's face off because someone else was talking while she wanted to so that's the first thing uh the second thing from a competitive nature one of the things i like to talk about is completely opposite to most people's opinions on the topic and it's the idea of comparing yourself to others and most people for the right reasons i think say don't compare yourself to others and i've got a different take where i directly compare myself to others all the time but i do that with my self-care in mind i don't do it in a way that's going to discourage me i do it in a way that's going to help me realize what's possible things that i never thought were possible before the specific example of that i've always shouted out like anyakubo and the coder coder and jesse from the code sector channel these are all youtube channels that were growing a lot faster than me at a certain time actually they're growing a lot faster than me right now too but i watched them like grow really really fast and i was like i've been doing this for longer i haven't seen near the amount of growth that they have what am i doing and i got really defeated about that for a while but then i started to have a little moment momentum and then i changed my goal and my perspective on that to look at like okay if they're able to get to this mark i'm gonna set that as my goal this year and i'm gonna look at what they're doing and then figure out how to help incorporate that into what i'm doing and achieve that growth never in my life would i've had a goal of reaching 100 000 subscribers on youtube last year never would have thought about that had i not seen other people do it so in that competitive nature like i directly compare myself to people all the time i do that in a way where i make sure that my self-care comes first and i don't use it as a negative but it helps me envision things that i probably never thought were possible for myself for sure so andrea why don't you go next and then brian will have you go after he does yeah sure and just continuing to james point here i think what what really matters is not not the bottom line or your metrics that you're looking at at the end of the day i see many times there are click baits quote unquote that that the community would be pushing right just for the sake of clicking when you click and just go read the tweet or read the link it's just some pushing the propaganda or something like that what really matters is are you pushing a meaningful content which can add somebody's purpose or which can help somebody as some someone was mentioning are you really helping someone if you like that then it's good to be a developer um that's that's the first i would say um point to consider whether you like to push meaningful content and whether you really like to help somebody rather than just getting your metrics or your followers or number of clicks that's that's all secondary it just comes when you add value to the community yeah i agree with that for sure brian do you want to jump in you got a question i i definitely agree with indra just shared there like it's something that tends to happen in this type of role of like you know you know we talk about vanity metrics getting caught up in that and like what are the trends on things like brazil was talking about tick tock before it's you kind of don't want to get caught up in that because you're per you if you focus on your purpose of what why you're on the platform and stuff like that um but my thing was more so uh back to what james was saying i wanted to ask him and anybody else's feeling because like i feel like for me i've struggled in the past with i've had moments where i've had that mentality of like yes let me i see these people that are doing really well and that's like that's showing the the possibilities that i could potentially attain in my own way right but uh but then there's times where i still find myself getting caught up in that comparison in a negative way and so what like i feel like maybe there's stages to getting to that so my question really is like james how did you get to that mentality so that we can all learn to do the same because right now i feel like i'm still in this stage of like i need to put my blinders on and just focus on me and how i can compete with myself my you know i mean i can get better that way some of my personal confidence and a lot of different things where i am in my career just comes from experience and that's not an experience that you don't have like i think we're at a pretty similar stage in our careers but the reality of what i said is like that's my motivational side of like what i want to communicate of how it can be good the reality is like i still struggle with that every day too like i'm going through a dip in youtube personally that's like i just messaged my wife earlier i'm like i feel like i can't do anything right on youtube no video every video is doing worse than the video before and it's like a terrible spot for me right now on youtube specifically so the reality is like that's a really hard balance for me right now i'm just feeling like damn i don't know what i'm not doing i don't know what's wrong but this really sucks it makes me not want to do my next video in some ways it makes me want to do my next video even more because i want to have another chance to do better so it's definitely balanced i don't think that thing goes away i think the the thing to encourage people to practice and this is a practice thing is recognizing when you start to use that as negative and then maybe distance yourself from it i don't think there's anything wrong with like recognizing that's not beneficial for you at this time and then backing away from it and when you're in a more like positive mindset or you have other positive things going on go ahead and capitalize on that and now start to look at like what else is possible from other people and start to internalize that and build on it when you have that level of positivity but all the all the motivational things that i have all the motivational things that i tell myself they come in ways but i do try really intentionally to continue to tell myself the positive things especially when i'm really down and i think that's a hard thing that a lot of people haven't i think that's a lot of something that a lot of other people struggle more than i do because i just force myself to say it doesn't necessarily change things overnight but i try to keep that keep that positive intention even when things start to get seeming super negative yeah i think when you when we think about like our careers and even our lives in general like you said like there's ebbs and flows right like there's the good days and the bad days and i think the struggle of what we need to try to do is try to figure out well how can we take that negative energy and turn it into positive energy right like how can we take that like that anxiety and turn it into motivation and be like okay well my video didn't do this well this week i'm gonna try harder to do the next one or my teammates are writing more blog posts to me like how can i like you know do something to to show my value does that make sense right but that's always a very hard thing to do um let's go with we're going to do tech rally next and then rizzo i'll see you got your hand up i'll have you go in right after hey uh thanks for having me out this is just a i've been a software engineer for a bit now and it's pretty kind of straightforward in terms of what i need to get done and how i get evaluated how as a developer advocate i know you guys were talking about like vanity metrics and all those things like how important is that in terms of like getting raises or promotions and all those things because it sounds like that's a pretty difficult way to and a lot of pressure for an individual to be responsible for because that there's like a level of like marketing and all that stuff that is not really um i feel like you could hire people for that kind of aspects of it like if you're just responsible for pure content and then someone else is responsible so for somehow marketing like i think that'll make life a lot easier but i'd be curious um if that is also something that is measured against you and if it is like how do you deal with that type of pressure yeah i see you put your hand up i'm guessing it's for that question do you want to go ahead and take a shot at answering it yeah and i think this also plays into a struggle where the answer is always it depends um and i'm so annoyed with that answer because anytime i have a question the answer is always well it depends it's like no it doesn't depend like there's an answer to it and my answer to this is determined by your company some companies will focus on your clout and some companies will focus on your effectiveness and i think you choosing where you want to work will be dependent on that now obviously the bottom line is what's going to matter at the end of the day if like you're creating all this stuff and then you know we see it all the time advocate gets a big following advocate besides being an advocate for the company isn't as effective as going independent doing the independent thing advocate leaves company and does the independent thing some companies want that some companies need that they need a face to associate with their brand other companies are not here for that so i think in terms of vanity metrics i think they're always going to be metrics that make people get excited make people get happy but at the end of the day depending on the company that you work for your metrics versus their metrics will always matter where i'm at now i'm not even thinking about what i'm doing personally because my personal brand has always been help one-on-one reach one reach one if i reach one i can reach talent i just have to do it one at a time and they'll go out and do the same thing but in terms of the content that i'm creating i'm having to think about it from the perspective of if i reach one person on this i'm gonna lose my job so let me start to think about how i reach more than one and and that means that the company can own that content i don't need that it's not my brand it's not my style so i think in terms of measuring your metrics it is going to depend on the company that you work for some will want you to just build your brand and do your thing some will say honestly if you're just another advocate on the team and the numbers keep going up for us we don't really care what's happening in your world uh rosella i know you had your hand up for a long time i didn't forget about you so did you have something that you wanted to ask or jump in with um it was it was like the the conversation passed it was about the the competition thing um that brian was asking about and how to keep a healthy mindset i was only going to add that i normally make my quote-unquote competition be someone that i can i know i can't reach that goal like let's say i'm like oh i want to be like angie jones she's light years ahead of me i'm not going to be at that level but i'm just like slowly trying to crawl up to that level if that makes any sense but i'd like us to go back to the the other conversation so don't worry about me no it's all good man like i just want to make sure everyone gets their moment to make whatever question and make whatever statement they need to make uh dk i see you got your hand up do you have a question or something you want to talk about um i do so thank you guys for hosting this space um i happened to just see it yesterday a little bit of background about me is i'm a brand new developer advocate like i literally hit a month yesterday i'm at a company i'm the first developer advocate so there's no program no mentorship um my boss is a product manager with no development background um so with all that being said i've spent a lot of time kind of understanding what they actually needed um from a developer advocate and like what made them kind of look for one in the first place um so now that i'm they i'm here where i'm like okay i have a place i know i can start at um i'm currently like doing a lot of research just kind of looking at other developer advocates and wanted to know um do you guys have one do you guys have mentors outside of your job i know a lot of you are at bigger companies who have established programs um so you may have like a mentor within your company um but do you have mentors outside of you know or developer relation mentors outside of your office your job and do you know of any like conferences or meetups for people like me who may be at like smaller companies with no program in existence brazil you want to you want to jump in yeah i would say if you haven't already you should join the devrel collective slack um because i do have a mentor outside of my job because i just wanted to see like what are other companies doing like i don't want to only be in like the github devrel mindset like if i go to a different company i want to know how they're approaching things so the reason why i mentioned the slack is because they have a channel called mentorship and i just like wrote in the slack and i was like hey can anyone mentor me and people responded so that's one suggestion all right uh jay and then james do you want to go after that yeah coming in one one of my mentors is posting this call so uh thank you for that uh and and sometimes i think that there can be a [Music] unspoken mentorship like hey i look at you as a mentor i use the term like big bro big sister i'm like um that is that has been helpful to me and i think a lot of that has been looking at i mean we all at some point we all want to be at the top you know principal advocate you know advocate manager director deborah like all those things but i think figuring out where you you really want to enjoy your time or you really want to get into a spot and you know james mentioned looking to people that drive him to get to that point i think in a way like having those people be your mentors um i i'm open when i say like you know b dougie is a mentor to me like there's not at least a month that goes about right i'll just paint him and be like hey here's what i'm working on here's what i'm thinking about here are the things i'm seeing in the industry here's how i feel about them but say you and luckily the community is pretty dope at least the community of like black developer advocates that i know that i affiliate with it seems like everybody is pretty on board to helping one another helping each other grow up until they get stronger um that being said i think that having someone that having someone that has a lot of your experiences uh and you know the phrase lived experiences and there's someone that that reminds you of you or where you want to be in the future is a great spot for a mentor but even if they don't have time to set up okay let's do a monthly zoom call like just let them know hey i see what you're doing i really want to like pick your brain sometimes you got a chance but if not just allow me to sit there and watch what you're doing and learn from that but also leave that invitation open so that they can hopefully build that mentorship and build those relationships because you know you're just starting out it's it's going to get real fun um but it only gets fun if you have people there to help you keep it fun and make it fun yeah i agree with that 100 uh james you got your hand up yeah i'll try to be quick um super reinforced the whole idea that like your mentor does not need to formally be a person they don't even need to know that you're a mentor i've got a million different mentors out there people that i look up to and i just pay attention to what they do like you said you've already been doing oh the first thing i meant to mention is congratulations on the new role by the way i saw you post about that and i followed you on twitter and youtube and i'm looking forward to your journey and content but there's plenty of mentor opportunities out there don't think that it has to be that formal one-on-one meeting every x number of months or whatever just like jay said um the second thing is never be afraid to ask be respectful of people's time understand that like people don't necessarily have the time to do it all but always ask and show appreciation the last thing i don't have any specific like conferences to recommend to you because i don't know enough about like your interest in uh what's going to be beneficial to you and your company but the thing i would say is just take advantage of the in-person time as best you can like i've been to a few conferences recently especially after being at home during covert for the last couple years and being in person with those people that you look up to is literally game changing like i get so much inspiration from just talking to the people that are around me in person and just the conversations that we have i'll walk away with so much inspiration like i said so much excitement so much uh that i could that i feel like i can bring back to my job on a daily basis so absolutely just take advantage of those in-person opportunities when they come along yeah for sure 100 agree with you too james um so folks thank you all for being here with uh switzer's twitter space um i do apologize again for the that brief pause in the middle where we had a little bit of technical difficulties but you know it wouldn't be an internet if stuff didn't happen um i want to say a huge thanks to our panel um i really feel like this conversation is getting super juicy right now but we do have to you know respect the time of everyone that's here and you know let them get back to their day jobs um definitely want to recommend you all follow our panel on twitter um if you're not already like go ahead and click the head little handles and stuff like that make sure you follow them make sure you check out like their youtube videos and their courses and some of the other cool things that they're doing and um and also too just before we leave i'm just gonna go around the room really quick and and give each of our folks a chance to maybe promote and talk about some of the cool things that they're doing so jay why don't i start with you and then we'll just kind of go around yeah so i just launched kind of a or relaunched a passion project of mine called diversity diversityorgs.tech think of it as a way for folks to connect with folks like them in their area in the tech space it's still rough around the edges it's still in beta i would love for people to try it out just search in your area search for the things you like uh as long as they're technically adjacent but hopefully you'll be following that story uh as i talk about deploying that on azure which is you know how i how i get paid so yeah diversity uh diversityorgs.tech is the site awesome brazil you want to go next oh dang i was trying to think of something um i i say go follow at gcodehouse on twitter um that's an organization that i work with that teaches women of color and non-very binary people of color to code um and i've been involved in it for like over three years so yeah also too i want to recommend folks go and follow result on dev.2. she writes a ton of cool articles she's not going to tell you but i'm going to tell you she writes a ton of dope stuff on on dev.2 um she wrote one just yesterday talking about some of her struggles as well as the developer advocates again definitely make sure you go ahead and check that out uh brian clark my friend you want to go next i got nothing to really promote i'm just happy to be here appreciate the conversation and uh and thanks maybe we can do another one sometime i love it man i love it it's all good um james sir you got anything you got i know you got tons of stuff going on man what do you what do you got i'm gonna start with uh plug in brian's tick tock since he didn't plug anything for himself i don't know if you posted much recently but uh his tick tock stuff is fun so go and follow him on tick tock um i run a podcast called compressed fm uh where my co-host and i amy dutton talk about web development and design so if you're interested in any of those things go and check it out at compressed.fm awesome and do i have anything to talk about i don't think i do oh please follow the stripe dev um youtube channel and also our twitter handle if you haven't already we are creating tons of cool awesome videos around payments and things of that nature uh but more importantly i do think this conversation could go on a lot longer so if folks are interested in us doing more we're continuing this conversation and talking about like some of the things that developer advocates have to face and deal with why don't you go ahead and give us a thumbs up let us know that you're still there let us know if you're still interested and let us know if this may or may not be something that you want to you want to talk about again in the future but with that being said um i think we're pretty much done right so thank you again for our panel thank all of you that are here that have been listening to us really appreciate it and uh we'll see you again for another stripe deadlife bye everybody\", metadata={'source': '03F_I8Rxfwc', 'title': 'StripeDev Live: Struggles of a developer advocate', 'description':

Document(page_content=\"in this video we're going to be using the details from our checkout session to display a custom order confirmation page to our customer after they've completed payment and have been redirected back to our site now we'll be building on top of code that was generated using the checkout quickstart integration builder if you don't already have this code you can find links in this video's description to the quick start and also to other videos inside of the series let's quickly review our application inside of our code we have a route called create checkout session that's called whenever our customer clicks the checkout button on our checkout.html page this route generates the underlying checkout session object that redirects our customer to stripes hosted checkout when the customer completes payment they are redirected back to the success.html file which at the moment is really just the static html page what we're going to do is change that and use the information that we get from the checkout session object to display a more customized page back inside of our checkout controller the first thing that we're going to want to do is update our success url what we're doing here is adding the session id to that route so whenever our user gets redirected to that page it'll have the id for the checkout session that we could use to get more information about what happened back in our code i'm going to add a javascript file called success.js and a script tag referencing it from success.html inside the javascript file we'll use the session id we received as a url parameter and pass it back to the backend via the order info route inside of our controller we can see the order info route will take a session id parameter and use it with the session service class to make an api call to retrieve the session object now the session object does not contain the customer data by default so using the session get options class we'll set the expand property so our request will include the customer information this is a very useful technique as it saves us from having to make multiple api calls now let's test this out on the server what i'm going to do is test this out right inside of the browser so i'm just going to go ahead and update this route call it order info and as you can see here our results are returned so we know that order info route is working let's go back to our success.html file and add some markup to display the information i'm going to give my section element a class of order info and i'll add some list elements also for this example i'm going to display the name and email address of the customer the order total and also the payment status next we'll need to style this up a little bit so instead of my style.css file i'm going to add some class specific styles i'll set the height and the list style for the unordered list to be none i'll remove the flex style from the paragraph so it spans the whole width of the section and lastly i'll center the header at the top now let's go back to our success.jss file we'll update the javascript to insert the customer and order information into the html that we just wrote to get started i created a helper function set text that will update the content of the given element i'll use this to display the name and email address from the customer object in the session if i don't have the customer object i can also pull the email from the session itself next i'll display the payment status attribute from the session object to display the readable order total i'll start by creating a currency formatter set to the session currency payment amounts are expressed using the smallest unit for the currency our price is in dollars so the amount total will be returned to us in cents because of that we'll need to divide by 100. now if we head back to our success page and we refresh we'll see that it's displaying order specific information instead of the old static page let's quickly review what we've done so far we appended the checkout session id template to the success url attribute we passed in when we created our checkout session this gave us access to the session id when our customer was redirected after completing checkout we took the id send it back to our server and made an api call to get the checkout session and also the associated customer we use this information in these objects to display a customized page if we go through our checkout floor one more time we can see that our cancel page is also static it might be a good idea if we allow our customers to return to their checkout session from this page we can do this by adding the checkout session template variable to our cancel url just like we did for our success url now if we head over to the cancel.html i'm going to add a form button that will allow us to return a checkout by default we'll set the action of the form to create a new checkout session in the event that someone lands on this page and there's no session id in the url we'll also add a little bit of javascript to the page to grab the session id from the url and change the form action to a new route which takes the id as a parameter if we head back over to our controller we're going to add a new route called return to checkout session and it's going to take the session id as a parameter it'll retrieve the associated session object and then it'll redirect the customer to checkout using the session url let's go through the checkout floor one more time i'm going to return to our session page i'm going to hit checkout if i cancel it now you see we have this button that says return to checkout if i click it now i should be able to fill out the form and on completing this form we should get redirected back to our success page thanks so much for watching and i do hope that you found this video useful if you want to learn more about checkout make sure you check out the resources inside of

to cancel a reader action so that you can cancel in-flight payment now this is part of a longer series so if you haven't seen our previous episodes on collecting payments listing readers or registering and connecting to readers check those out first otherwise you can follow along by cloning the github repo below let's get started [Music] sometimes a customer will decide that they want to buy one less thing and that means we need to be able to reset the transaction on the reader and inside of our application and then try a new payment and send that to the reader instead to do this we'll be adding functionality to the cancel button as before we'll hop into server.js for our express server and create a route this route is going to be for canceling a reader action this will expect a reader id from the request body which will then send to stripe using the cancel action method once this returns we'll send back our new reader object at the same time the physical reader will return to its idle state on the front end we'll update the cancel action click handler for our cancel button so that it uses the cancel action endpoint we just created we'll also add a message and reset the application state now when we try our application if we click on process we can cancel the action and it will reset our reader and reset the reader object that represents what's happening on the reader one thing to know about the cancel action is that while it resets the reader it does not actually cancel the payment so if you click process to hand off a payment to the reader and the customer does not actually tap their card you can click cancel and you can effectively cancel the payment however the cancel button and the cancel action only affects the reader does not actually cancel the payment directly so if a user were to actually tap their card and you click cancel the only thing it will do is reset the reader if you go look at the payment the payment will be uncaptured or completed if you actually want to cancel the payment you will need to actually cancel it with the payment intent api and we'll talk about that in a future episode but for now just know that canceling only cancels actions for the reader it does not actually cancel the underlying payment incentive you need to use the dashboard as you see here or the api to do that you\", metadata={'source':

you might know that you can retrieve resources like customers and payment attempts from the api by listing them and if you need more resources you can page through that data using pagination you might even have used the really useful auto pagination features from one of our client libraries depending on your use case you may have been looking for particular customers or payment intents based on their attributes like email or currency well now there's a way to search for those resources without listing and iterating using the new search api the search api allows you to search directly for the resources that you're interested in in one api call by passing a query to the api paging through search results is possible and our client libraries also support auto pagination for search results in this dev by you'll learn how to query the api about the fundamental operators like exact matching and substring matching and combining filters using boolean operators let's take a look [Music] let's start with a very simple search query we'll search for all payment intents in a particular currency in this case let's search for payment intents in euros i'm using ruby for this example but you could use any of our officially maintained striped client libraries we're printing out the data array which is the list of results from the search if we scroll up we can see a list of payment intents let's look at the parts of this query a query is made up of one or more clauses clauses of combination of a field an operator and a value in this simple case the field is the currency the colon is our exact match operator and the value is the string e u r for euros so that we're not always looking at so much data let's print out the values that we're interested in in this case let's grab the id amount and currency you can search for values that are nested in objects too payment intents are state machines that produce charges so let's search for charges that used a specific card last four number so now we have all charges that used to that 4242 card let's try out searching for results using a compound query with multiple clauses we'll search for charges that use the card with last4 of 4242 or 3155 now we have a data set including charges that use the card with last 4 of 4242 or 3155 negation of clauses is also supported by using the minus operator let's search for all payments that use the 4242 card and aren't in euros so now we have all non-euro charges for that card when using multiple query clauses and is the default so it can be excluded if you like let's look at string matching we'll search for customers with an exact match of their email address notice that we have to escape the quotes in the string when passing it as a value using single quotes there the customer jenny rosen has that email address but we can also search using the substring operator which is the tilde character we'll search for anybody who has jenny in their email address there are two customers with that substring in their email let's take a moment to look at field types now that we've experimented with exact matches string matches and substring matches there are three types of field token string and numeric if a field type is token it's used for exact matches disregarding the case strings can be matched exactly under substrings which we've just seen and finally numeric field types can be matched exactly but also using greater than or less than logic there's too many to cover now but the docs list every field that can be searched and its type let's do some numeric searches we'll go back to payment intents and search for those that are over a certain amount we'll take 10 euros in stripe amounts are represented in the smallest currency denominations so therefore 10 euros or dollars is 1 000 cents nice we have all payment intents over 10 euros greater than and less than can also be combined with equals let's get all payment intents that are greater than or equal to 10 euros metadata on searchable objects is also supported so you can now search for arbitrary key value data that you store on your objects let's search for all payment intents that matched metadata where i stored a key in value of foo and bar and just like other attributes we can combine clauses for metadata you can also query for the presence of a metadata key on an object using the minus operator and the special value of null for example the following clause would match all records where foo is a metadata key so now you're fully equipped to start using the search api to build custom queries for your system you could leverage the api for example to build a custom dashboard for searching for charges based on status or finding customers by email for support cases and much more you can search for charges customers invoices payment intents prices products and subscriptions and searches available in all of our official stripe client libraries a note on versioning search is supported on api versions 202027 or higher with a new search api you have a rich query interface to your stripe resources this empowers you to build new solutions and interfaces that will streamline your processes and help to build your business if you have any questions feedback queries don't hesitate to reach out to us at stripedv on twitter or join in the conversation on our discord server

follow the prompt to run in the stripe dashboard let's navigate over to our hello world viewport which is in the customer detail page and then we have our app running now let's start with a quick overview of the more common components by diving into the code every stripe app should have a context view component at its root you can use this component to display some information about your app

let's switch back to the browser and we'll see the app there has updated to reflect our changes stripe apps has the same hop module reloading experience you'd expect from a modern front-end framework similarly any errors will be displayed in both the browser and your terminal window you might have noticed that contextview comes with the props user context and environment these contain information about the stripe accounts the app is running on and data about the environment let's use some of context fuse props to show off some of the details in these variables we'll use the description and banner props to show the account id and customer id let's start by adding to our context view some additional props we'll add a description and in here we're going to add let's say the account id so we'll say account is equal to usercontext.account.id let's save this see what this looks like there we go we have our account id is listed there and then next let's show a banner so what i'm going to do is type banner equals and this is going to be some jsx i'm going to return i want to add a banner which i'll add here it's going to be the type default i'll give it the title of customer and the description is going to be our environment object context dot id i'm going to make sure in case this is null and that is going to be the end of our banner component let's save go back to our app and here we see we have the customer id as well next let's add interaction like some data we want to capture the best way to do that is with a focus view which allows you to open a dedicated focus space that is ideal for data input let's add the focus view in a button that triggers the opening of that view by editing some state we unless you set up a react's use state hook so let's first create some states we'll say const show data input set show data input equals use state which is going to have a default or type of boolean most of the default defaults next within our context field we want a button we'll tab it the type of primary so that it stands out a bit more and we'll have an on press function now we unpress we want to say set show data input to true and then within the button we'll call this add item like so let's save there we have our button of course when we click it it'll send some states but it won't be reflected in the eui anywhere so let's change that on the default button let's add a focus view the focus view is going to have a title of data input we need a property shown which determines whether we want to show the focus view or not and here we'll simply use show data input the variable we created earlier and finally we did an unclose function for now this is what will trigger when you click the x button the top right of the focus view and here we'll just say shut show data inputs to false let's close our focus view and we'll leave it empty just for now let's save this go back to our app click add item and here we have our focus view but of course we can't do anything with it yet because it's pretty empty but at least we didn't know that if you click the x button it should close and you can reopen it now let's populate our focus view with a text area we'll add a label and an area label for accessibility when you add data into the text area we'll automatically save a new state new item so let's start with creating our state of new item and set new item which is going to be using the use state hook which has type string and we'll default to an empty string now in our focus view let's add a text area we'll give it the label of add new item we'll give it an area label because accessibility is very important of add new item as well add a placeholder enter new item and an unchanged function so the ontreat function is going to take an event and here we're going to use our state setter we just created which is set new item e dot target dot value and then we'll self close this text area let's go check it out let's click add item and here we have a little text area so we can type stuff in here which will change the state but we have no way of actually saving it yet so let's fix that we'll go back to our code and within our focus view let's also add primary action and secondary action props to our focus view these will control the save and cancel actions in our view so let's start with a primary action which is going to take some jsx in here we'll add a button which will set the type to primary because you want this to draw the most attention we'll have an on umpress in here we want to call a function called add new item which doesn't actually exist yet but that's okay we'll just step this out then in here we want to say have this button say save next we want a secondary action which is going to look very similar we're going to have a button this time it'll just remain the default we'll just have an on press prop and in here it's quite simply we want to close the focus view so we'll say set show data inputs defaults and this will just be a cancel button so let's save this go back to our code add item here we have our cancel and save button nicely positioned in the bottom right hand corner with a nice color for save and a default color for cancel so clicking cancel should just return me back to the main page but clicking save doesn't do anything just yet because we don't have this add new item function so let's do something about that let's say const add new item equals this function so now we have this data what should we do with it let's use it to build a list of items now let's use some new state something called items to be able to capture the new state we'll capture the new items so we'll say this is use state and this is going to be type an array of strings this will default to an empty array in add new item let's say set items items dot concat new item let's clean up after ourselves by saying set show date input to false to close the focus view and set new item back to empty string so now we have that data let's do something with it let's add a list of items to our state that way we can use that to populate the list component of list items going here underneath our focus view let's add a list we'll give it an aria label prop which we'll say is list of data and inside list let's map over our items and i think we'll need the index as well and we'll return a list item component inside this list item we'll give it a title would this be the item itself we'll give it a key which will use the index and we'll close off this component let's save that go back to our to our app let's say let's add an item we'll say new item one click save there we have that let's try another one just for sure to make sure it works new item two click save now we have our second item and there we have it a super simple app that takes some data and renders it in a list so that was a quick intro to some of the more common components included in the ui extensions sdk you can learn

everyone to stripe dev live um this might be a little bit different from some of the other ones we've done before if you've been on distracted live before generally we usually do these on discord but we said hey why not try something new and different and try it on the twitter space so if you all like this type of format if you think this is pretty cool we should do more of these let us know after this conversation and we can definitely talk about that but uh today i'm really excited about this conversation because i think we're going to be talking about something that's very near and dear to a lot of us and and something that has like a lot of deep emotional roots and our panel today is a group of amazing developer advocates across a lot of different companies and they're going to be talking this about some of the struggles that they've experienced and are even still going through as they're doing their day-to-day job and so i want to start off with really quickly i'm just going to call everyone to have them introduce themselves and then uh and then we'll dive into our conversation so james why don't we start with you yeah what's going on everyone um i from a developer advocate perspective i'm a developer advocate at a company called planetscale before that i was a developer advocate at alzero and then i actually started my career as a technical evangelist which is a more a little bit older term for basically the same type of thing at microsoft and i usually talk about three things that i do i'm a developer speaker and teacher and i've done some combination of those things professionally for about 10 years now awesome thank you james i appreciate you being here and brian clark hey everyone thanks for having me and uh my name is brian clark i'm a developer advocate at sneak uh prior to that i was at microsoft and then i was at disney as a engineering role before that and uh yeah happy to talk about the struggles of being a developer advocate awesome uh rozelle what about you you want to go next yeah sure uh hey everyone my name is rozelle i'm a developer advocate at github i'm pretty new to developer advocacy i've been uh here for like about 10 months before that i was a software engineer at like random startups that no one's ever heard of um and like everybody else i'm super excited to like just rant about the struggles of being a developer advocate oh i believe there will be a lot of ranting happening today that's for sure um jay why don't you go next one yeah sure um hey i'm jay miller i'm a senior cloud out there at microsoft before that i was a developer advocate of elastic and i've been in the industry for a couple of years but before that i was creating content mostly podcasting for about i think it's been eight years now so well aware of the industry but didn't know how to get in until a few years ago and uh happy to talk about that as well as some other struggles awesome and i guess i'll jump into like so my name is cecil phil for folks that may not know me um i'm also a developer advocate i've been in the industry for about 13 years and spent i want to say like the last five of those in advocacy you know working with developers and you know creating content and things of that nature and you know one of the things that i love about this panel of folks that we have is that i feel like everyone has a completely different level of experience in terms of like how they do their job how they got into advocacy in the first place and how they can think about like advocacy as a discipline within like the developer community too so i'm really interested in hearing what these folks have to say and also to folks that are listening um definitely feel free to go ahead and ask questions raise your hand we'll try and get you in and get some of your questions answered as we we have this uh this discussion so i want to start off with this question um because i think this is kind of kind of lead into some of the other things that we want to talk about and that is what does advocacy mean to you like what is what does developer advocacy actually mean and and why don't we start off with you like i'd love to hear what your take is on that question okay cool uh i guess advocacy means to me um just empowering developers as they use your product like i want to make sure as a as a developer advocate that people are not confused on how to use the product that they feel excited to use the product um and that it's just enabling them to do what they need to do what they do best which is their job um yeah i think to me that's that's developer advocacy listening to the the user making sure and the user being the developer making sure that they can they can succeed as developers nice and brian what about you i'd love to hear about what you think advocacy is and even to what what made you decide to get into advocacy in the first place oh you're gonna hit me with the double question now huh well i gotta give you extra work to do because you know i know i know you can handle it uh no i think razell hit it uh spot on um and yeah like the only thing i would i guess add to that is you know part of being a developer advocate to me is being able to be your authentic self and everything that not necessarily have to um because at times depending on who you're collaborating with at your your company maybe they're in sales or or whatever they they're gonna want you to approach things a certain way and you have to kind of push back and be like well that's not how i would share these things with developers or i don't believe that that would be of interest to a developer and so forth so being authentic and uh organic approaching things organically and not forcing things is uh the one little thing i would add to what what roselle already talked upon and then what was that second question again how did i get into devrel or developer what made you decide to get into it yeah so i mean as i was uh doing more engineering related when i was in my engineering role um i really just found myself enjoying um learning new things and then sharing what i learned with other colleagues so it started small with like just certain people on my immediate team like maybe a close friend that i made on my team and like saying hey this is cool thing i learned about and then that slowly expanded to doing more like luncheon learns and then like doing my first time speaking at an internal conference and i found myself just gravitating more and more towards activities like that and then an opportunity arose where i could get paid for that i was like heck yeah i'm gonna jump in on that opportunity i mean i was totally happy and i i foresaw myself you know living the rest of my life in that engineering role even at that original company um but i i saw it as like this is i need to challenge myself maybe and like see and pursue this further since i'm already feeling find myself gravitating towards those things and uh and that's where that's what led me to to where i'm at now you know what some of my friends some of my non-technical friends ask me what i do for a living i like to tell them i'm a i'm a teacher that teaches developers how to do stuff right um because i kind of look at developer advocacy as as an education first kind of role you know and it's education on both sides right we have to educate the company as to what developers need and what what the temperature of the room can is and but then also too we have to educate our our communities about again these products and practices and those types of things that you know we're obviously doing for the different companies right the other do you all agree with that do you think that makes sense i think there was a tweet a while back it was like maybe it was you actually that sent that to it was like what's going to happen in 20 years when all these developer advocates decide you know what i think i'm done with tech uh i think someone was like oh man high school teaching is is probably the night that's like the retirement career path for us and honestly i feel it like some of the most fun that i've had in this role is speaking to students speaking to college students even speaking to high school students and for me that was because i didn't know what i'm doing today was a job when i was their age so i want to have opportunities to expose them to those types of careers because one right now i think kids these days are just giving all of the the world of social media and things around them and how they navigate it and how they navigate it so fluently i think that it puts them in such an advantageous position for the future of devrel but that being said no one's talking about that you know on career day at high school in high school so for me i love the idea of teaching but i also love the idea of exposing new career opportunities and ideas to that next generation yeah i agree with that 100 percent uh it looks like crystals looks like i'm going to try and get you on uh i think crystals has a question this is not working for me while you're doing i wanted to add really quickly on the the concept of people not knowing that devrel developer relations by the way so there's developer advocate as a job developer relations is usually a team but denver being an opportunity that people don't know about and this is 100 of the truth for me coming out of college i applied for microsoft for a regular software development job that i didn't get applied for another role didn't get it and then they were like what do you think about uh technical evangelist i was like i don't know but this is microsoft so sure and that's like it's really sad but the reality is that's where the majority of the jobs are it's just like traditional software engineering but devrella's growing more and more and people are seeing more about what develop can do and they're getting hired on earlier at companies and so i think that visibility of this being an option is continuing to grow which is really exciting yeah i agree with you crystals i think you're online did you have a question you wanted to ask the folks yep hey guys um i've been a developer advocate for three years officially and unofficially for eight years uh it's probably one of the most fun and exciting jobs in anyone's tech career so if you get a chance to do it i would say for most people that have done developer advocacy how do you find rewards and getting recognized for the work that you do because advocating to developers is fantastic especially when you have a large audience but how do you take that and make it measurable so you can go back to your manager and show the impact yeah i agree with you and and i think that's a good segue right like let's let's kind of start diving into what some of these struggles that we do have as developers developer advocates are um i know this actually kind of started with an article that james wrote james quick wrote an article called top five struggles of the developer advocate and you know we had a conversation and we thought this would be a really great twitter space because i'm sure there's tons of folks that are in advocacy or trying to get into advocacy that would love to you know hear what other people's experiences are and you know kind of like what christos mentioned like one of the big things that i think all of us experienced as advocates is trying to figure out well how do we measure success right like how do we know that we're doing a good job how do we know that we're doing the right job and and not only how do we know that we're doing a good job but how do we let our you know our leadership team know that we're doing a good job as well um and so james why don't i pass it to you and maybe you could talk about that for a little bit yeah i'll do a slightly different take so i think like especially in the article that roselle wrote after mine she touched on like the metrics are tough and i think that's a consistent theme so i'm sure everyone will have more to talk about there but i also want to talk about the like raising awareness for what you're doing and this is something that i've significantly struggled with in my career and especially my time at microsoft where it was my first job out of college and i felt like i was doing as impactful of events and activities as anyone else especially with my level of experience and for the first year that worked really well second year i didn't get it's not the recognition for like making me feel good it was like end of year reviews didn't match up with what i thought i had done like the level that i thought i performed at and i realized that people around me that were getting more recognition and just people were more aware of their activities were more comfortable talking about themselves and at the time like i was kind of turned off by this idea because i was like i don't feel like like i don't i don't need to talk about myself all the time that's just not naturally who i am but that also is part of in any career but especially in denver is being able to craft that story about the impact that you have and we can get into like what metrics do you track specifically and all those things but oftentimes it comes down to like how well can you tell the story of the impact and some of that is like i had a one-on-one conversation with an individual developer and they went on to do this that's like that's as impactful as speaking to a room full of 100 people at a conference or it can be depending on how you phrase it so i think a lot of us feel really uncomfortable not bragging but like we feel like we're bragging by talking about ourselves and our accomplishments and i think one of the things that you kind of have to step outside of or kind of have to force yourself to be a little uncomfortable is just becoming more comfortable talking about yourself because otherwise like it's the tree falls in the forest doesn't make a sound type thing if no one's around like you're not no one's gonna know unless you tell that story story so the further you progress in your career hopefully you can push yourself to be a little bit more comfortable to take control of that narrative and feel more comfortable sharing your story with people and do that in a way that hopefully to other people into yourself doesn't feel like you're going out of your way to brag about the work that you're doing yeah brian you got your handle yeah i just i felt really strongly about what james just shared and i i i don't know i tend to over index onto the side of um you know being i have a strong aversion towards talking highly of myself in general and i over index on that a bit but i've quickly learned a hard lesson from this because i was of the mentality that like my work will speak for itself and i should just naturally get recognized for that work because like i don't i don't i shouldn't have to need to talk about it right that just people should be good about that but the reality is like your your leader is they have their own responsibilities and they're busy with their own things at times and while they would love to be able to see everything that you do and all the impact you have you have to make note of it and bring that up and shed light on it because it's just not really possible for somebody so it still feels awkward to me and i'm actively working on getting better about doing that um but i've quickly learned especially in this role that it's it's a necessity yeah i definitely agree with what both of you all said um i know prior to prior to me being like a professional advocate and i used to do a podcast then one of the things i hated in that podcast was i hated having to listen to myself which is kind of work right considering that you're doing a podcast but even that to say like oh wow i you know we did a really good job of this interview or we did a really good job at interviewing this person like i refused to listen to it after the recording was done because i'm like i was there i know what happened i'm done i'm gonna walk away from it because it gives me like this level of anxiety you know and i'm sure a lot of us that probably do videos and do other forms of media probably feel the same way too right because this job is such a public facing job and then sometimes like that emotion and that anxiety kind of gets to us and we're like i hope people like it but i also i'm a little afraid to hear what the response is going to be like you know what i mean and so we kind of have to try and balance those emotions a little bit as we're trying to figure out well you know how can i best do my job right and how can i best achieve what i'm trying to do uh resolving your hands up i'm gonna let you jump in yeah i actually have a question um because y'all are more experienced than me but first i want i have like a little context so like i'm similar to what you're saying cecil like i i'm i'm kind of more of a shy person and i didn't even really consider developer advocacy until i started um teaching other women of color and i was like oh wait this is kind of cool i thought i'd be more scared of like speaking in front of people but i like it and i'm the same where i don't really want to re-listen to myself because my voice doesn't sound anything like what i thought it was um but my question to y'all is like how do you tastefully or like in a good way keep telling people about the work you're doing because i feel like i'm annoying like i feel like i'm posting in slacks posting in twitter i'm like hey i mean more content and i don't want to like um clog up everybody's feed but i still want people to be able to recognize my work so that i'd be able to advance in my career yeah i'll jump in real quick and then i'll let let some of our panel folks um talk about it but the way that i approach the job is i try to i try to put authenticity first in front of everything else and when i say that i mean hey if i if i really like this product or if i really like this programming language or this thing that i'm working on like i want to generally show my learning experience as i'm going through it if that makes sense versus oh hey i'm just like i'm not a ruby person i'm going to start posting in like ruby forms i'm not a you know typescript person whether i'm going to start posting typescript forms but hey i'm generally interested in learning about i don't know maybe serverless and microservices and so now i really want to in in you know and um embed myself in those communities and not just be there to to to give stuff but also receive as well right like it has to be like a symbiotic relationship that you know i'm learning from the community and they're learning from me as well and now we can kind of share a little bit and that for me makes me feel a little bit more authentic when i do it versus me being like oh hey we're doing a thing today or there's a particular event that happens i you know i drop a tweet or post and i disappear and then you know we move on to the next thing uh jay i see you get your hand up um i i wanna you know echo some of the thoughts that brazil had um the the live experience for a lot of you know black kids with anxiety growing up is often i'm not worth listening to and the things that i have to say aren't valid and that is something that i struggle with to this day like i i think probably one of the things that most of us on this panel have had are people have come to us and said like hey i love what you're doing and the the feeling there is often but what am i doing like what what what am i doing that makes me feel so [Music] valuable to you if you're you know an employer or to the community and you know we talk when james is talking about the idea of you know sharing those things and there's always talking about almost feeling as if you were annoying people uh with the idea of let me share everything let me tell everybody everything that i'm doing i think sometimes we have to do that for ourselves as well to show like oh wait no i am out here actually doing something i am out here making a commitment to you know this community but i'm also like working with my company as well like i'm showing value to my company but i'm also showing value to the community at the same time because when we don't see that when we don't see that value we immediately start getting into our head as you know james's first line in his blog post of like anxiety is real and like am i doing a good job if we don't have that validation in that feedback loop we don't think we are and i think a lot of that comes from the anxiety of doing this job but also some of the lived anxieties that we have just growing up yeah i love the i mean i love the honesty and transparency all the way around because this is i feel like deborah has always been our developer advocate has always been one of those positions that like seems celebrity like just because it's like usually a person that you see on youtube or at a conference or whatever um so i appreciate this whole thing but the one one thing i'll add that has just been like somewhat devrel specific and mainly just life is like typically we will always be the ones that fail to recognize our own value and some of that is just like based on a lot of different experiences some of that is just not taking the time to actually think about the impact that we have and my wife and i talk about this a lot like someone someone will come up to us similar to what you said jay and say like oh so impressive that you did x y or z whatever it is and we're like well that's just like that's part of my job but the reality is like develops a very specific set of skills that is not very common like this idea of being social enough being able to create content being able to get up in front of an audience and talk being able to do that from a technical perspective where you don't lose trust and you earn people's respect it's a really really tough set of skills and like if you're in that position there's already something there and one of the things i encourage people to do including myself like all the advice that i give other people and stuff that i continually try to work on is take that time out to think about what it is that you've done and what you've accomplished and why that's valuable because we often overlook it and the sharing aspects like the and the lack of validation the one one other thing i'll add is just to try to have open conversations with manager and peers uh to say like do you think i'm sharing enough do you think i'm sharing too much do you think i'm doing a good job like don't be afraid to ask for that feedback and use that as something that you can act on yeah i think that's a really good point and one thing i would love to add to that is you know for a lot of us you know a lot of us have way different experiences you know in terms of tenure and even companies that we've worked for and sometimes we can be in a position where like we ask for feedback internally and like we just don't get it right or you know we don't we don't we don't get like the detail of information that we needed to know whether we're doing a good job or not and then that also can cause a lot of anxiety right like when you're not getting from your leadership like the communication right and like the clear instructions about what exactly is expected of you or how well you're doing then that too could give you like a sense of like uncertainty and so for me like whenever that's happened in the past like i look out to my community right like usually the community or folks in other departments whatever would say hey you're doing a good job this was really helpful you know this this made me feel um way better because it made me feel like i'm not wasting my time just like doing random things for for what for what point you know what i mean um and i think that too also kind of leads into another conversation that i i kind of want us to dive into and inside of advocacy like we all have a tons of different like responsibilities and different things to focus on like how do you choose what you focus on like how do you choose this is the thing right now that we're gonna put our time in and why don't i start with jay jay i see you get your hand up man so why don't you you take that question first i i want to say uh i don't choose things they choose me um and i i mean that in almost full honesty of having adhd and just understanding that i will go down certain paths and sometimes the answer is just you gotta go down that path until you hit a dead end and go somewhere else um it it really does feel that way at times and i think that that is that is a struggle um you know i i think i tweeted about this the other week like one of my favorite lines uh in any really long monologue on a record is the last lines of camp from donald lover and he talks about like i got on the bus a boy and i never got off the bus and and then like the start of the next album is talking about sometimes you just gotta get off the bus so that that to me is very much the feeling of like i will find something and it will just it will just crawl into my brain and i'll be thinking about it all day i'm like i i got it i gotta chase this itch i gotta figure it out um hopefully like i think the way that you can usually help to off ramp that is like open communication i think a lot of the answers here are going to be open communication talk talk to your bosses talk to your colleagues like does anybody else have this problem is it okay if i it's okay if i go down this road for a little bit and then from there like once once it's been co-signed on you're like cool all right let's let's dive into this let's build this let's make it work you know jay and i were just talking really quickly and i was asking the question you know what happens when you get assigned to do like a job or project or you know work on a product you know from an advocacy perspective but you're just you're just not interested in it right like you don't have the passion or you know you're not you know you're not interested in learning that topic right like what do you do and i'm going to jump into like jay you were talking about it right so do you want to chime in really quick uh only if i can share some advice that i got from my big brother in the industry a guy named cecil phillips you know i one of the things that i love about the industry is we have there's a lot of mentorship that happens and being able to have conversations with people and have open conversations and be like yo i'm really struggling with this right now and uh the advice that i got was sometimes you just gotta burn through it like make the thing get the thing done um invite people to collaborate to make it better i definitely will always say like it's it's so much easier to uh bear with the process if you have other people bearing with you versus you trying to take it all on your own but i i think that tech in general is so flexible that we often can find a way to to make even some of the most just dry topics interesting and i think that's like you have to in sometimes find a way to say oh this thing is kind of dry kind of boring but what if we what if we took a new spin on what if we remixed it and and turned it into something that looks at a traditionally dry topic with a little bit more uh interesting flavor to it so result i know you're you're like the freshest advocate out of the panel that's here what is what has that experience been like for you like choosing what products to work on or being told what products to work out and then having to you know find the energy and the motivation to do things that sometimes you don't want to do yeah i mean i'm a pretty ex like you can get me excited about like anything you can be like you have to write about something really boring and i'll be like yeah let's do it um especially when i first started um in developer advocacy just because i was just so excited that i had this job i was like oh my gosh i'm like excited and ready to do everything um so like i essentially tried out different media formats different topics and like that helped me to figure out the things i don't like to do like for example my team is like really big on like creating youtube shorts and tick tocks and i'm i'm just like not i don't like doing it um it's not fun for me um so what i ended up doing like i tried it out um and i just kind of told brian like i don't like doing this as much um and he was like that's fine especially because i found different ways to show my value like my team wasn't creating as many blog posts as me so i would just like put out mad blog posts and it's like okay that's okay because like you're offsetting it with that and then if there's like topics i don't really like as much i usually try to think of like how would i have made this exciting for myself like if i was the learner and that makes me like more engaged and interested while i'm like creating that content or learning that topic um but there are times where like i for example i know like co-pilot's a little bit of a a controversial topic i don't really um always want to to talk about certain topics like that um but i'm i'm trying to find ways to do it in a way that's like less controversial or um changes their perspective a little bit so yeah that i kind of rambled but those are my thoughts no that totally makes sense james you got your hand up yeah i love that um one interesting thing about me in the full transparency i've gotten the feedback before which i think is completely appropriate that like if it's not something that i already believe in that i kind of shut it down too fast so this is from sam gillin who's uh director of denver law zero and i shout him out because this is like really valuable piece of feedback and i think it's definitely true it's something i have to balance with but i also have this perspective of like as much as possible why would i spend time doing something if it's not something that i'm excited about now there's obviously a balance right like you have to do things sometimes that you're not excited about but i think everyone's first approach should be like either how can i do less of the thing that i'm not excited about or something kind of similar to what's been said like how do i turn this thing into something that i am more excited about and i had a conversation recently with my current vp of like talking about transitioning some of the content that we're doing and me just being honest i was like i i don't know if one that's not something i'm excited about but also i don't know that i think that's the best use of my time for these reasons and i'm kind of curious like i still think there's probably a little bit more of a conversation for us to have on that and i definitely had to fight that balance of pushing back too early while also considering like this is an opportunity for myself to do something different um but the the output of that is like just by having the conversation and being honest and giving a reason for why i think something else would be a better use of my time um being able to basically run with that idea instead while also keeping in mind like i have this thing that i would rather do but also having to translate that back to the reason that you wanted me to do this other thing the thing we were trying to accomplish or do better at i think i can push that needle cliche thing but i think i can impact that thing better by doing it this way so i think just having the conversation always starting with an approach of like things that we do should be fun i i have worked with plenty of people who just accept that everything in the world sucks and that's the way it's going to be and that's not the kind of person that i want to be but there is that balance of like making sure that you're being a team player that you're open to ideas and then uh figuring out what the best way to capitalize on that is yeah i i totally agree with you like it's always about a good balance right and for folks that are listening like we definitely don't want to make it sound like oh developer advocates or a bunch of divas that only want to work on stuff they want to work on but i think there's also the point that a part of our job is to get our communities and other developers and industry excited about the things that you know that we're showing it right like whether we're talking about like a new programming language feature a cloud thing or i don't know whatever whatever product it is we're working on like our job is to get you excited about it and if we're not excited about it it's very hard to be you know not our authentic selves to go out and kind of push that right like that's you know that's very disingenuous right and so that's why it's important for us to believe in the things that we're talking about because if we truly believe it then you know you'll see the authenticity in our videos and our content and the things that we create and it won't feel like a forced process uh brian i see you guys your hand up yeah i don't have much more to add because you all hit on the things that were going through my mind balance being team player uh the one thing i wanted to add about uh you know choosing what what you like to work on versus what you don't like to work on i think whether you're dev advocate or you're an engineer you're in any career as you kind of progress on you start learning more about yourself and what you enjoy doing and not to get all you know like philosophical or anything like that but like you you know you only have so much time in your life and your job that you're doing so you want to spend and capitalize as much time of that doing the things you enjoyed doing um and so i think that's the the the driver behind a lot of this at times but again all this stuff that you all said already plays into it too so it's just it's not necessarily doing that 100 of the time it's balancing and and supporting team players like the biggest thing that comes to mind to me is like i will suck it up and just do what needs to be done because we want to win the game we want to have the impact on developers in our company so uh yeah yeah for sure and uh jesse i saw you we uh we just uh let you in man so you had a question or something you wanted to add to the conversation yeah i just wanted to add in a super cool conversation here by the way uh but one of the topics too about for develop developer advocacy is a great question is why am i not excited about that so when there are these really dry topics i mean listicles are still listicles at the end of the day but like if there's a topic where you're like man i just can't get behind this um that's totally an opportunity too to actually look into it and say um yeah like what is i don't understand about this and why it's meaningful for the space that i'm in and maybe it's an opportunity to learn and actually you know stretch out into a new category with a question kind of playing off of that one of the things that i feel as a driver in our careers is the ability to communicate and i guess i don't want to say influence but like speak to other advocates about being an advocate and i'm not gonna lie like i love these conversations because it talks about like the hard part i don't like trying to tell other people how to do what they're doing because honestly you do you has gotten me pretty far in life but i i want to pose that question as kind of uh like how do you find excitement to do that thing that is like a career mover like most of us like we network with each other i think everyone here um on the panel is either currently or has currently worked in a company you know at the same company uh maybe in different times so it shows that it's a small world and people knowing each other is a thing but how do you find the excitement doing to just engage with one another professionally like is just that you know the i call the ice cream parlor because not everybody goes to the bar there's like just congregating at the ice cream collar or you know grabbing dinner after a conference or whatever just connecting with each other on a space is that enough and if it's not how do you push yourself over the edge to do more yeah that's a really good question um i can tell you for me like people excite me right like being able to learn from other people and and so come knowledge from them for me is always really exciting so sometimes you know i'll be in a position where i'll give an example like in a past life i used to work on a product that dealt with taxes i'll be honest with you taxes isn't the most riveting thing to talk about at least not for me but at the time i did have the opportunity to create and work on some software that i thought was really interesting so like the technology was interesting to me and how we were solving the problem was interesting to me you know what i mean the problem itself wasn't that interesting but like how we saw that was interesting and so i'm bringing it up because sometimes you have to find angles around to get the job done you know what i mean like so i don't know maybe you don't care about metrics or maybe you don't care about like you know open telemetry or ai or whatever the case is but hey i do might get the opportunity to work with some cool people i might get the opportunity to get some new skills i might get the opportunity to get in front of a different audience of people that i haven't done before and that might be the interesting part about it and maybe that's how you can find that motivation uh rosella so you got your hand up yeah i will say i agree with you cecil i'm like there's there's two parts for me like one i try to find different angles a lot like i worked at an insurance tech company um as a software engineer that that sounds hella boring but like we had hackathons and that would be when we would come up with ideas of what else we could add to our product and like one of my ideas was like adding a translation feature so that like people who didn't speak um native um natively speak english could um use the app like that type of stuff made me excited because i'm excited to help people so like i always think of it that way like oh i'm even though i'm not that interested in this i'm excited to help someone like be able to use this because i just i don't know i just like helping people and then on the like more the less the less like self-less side i'm also pretty competitive and i want to be the best so like i will if there's some topic that i don't like i'll be like it's okay because i'm trying to i'm trying to be the best developer advocate so even if this is like something boring or hard i know it's going to make me improve as a developer advocate um and i approach like software engineering like the same way yeah i love it i love that competitive energy man 100 um james i see you got your hand up and then after james um indra asked to speak so after you we're gonna have him um go ahead and ask this question cool uh one thing i just realized is roselle is the one who obviously cut twitter's face off because someone else was talking while she wanted to so that's the first thing uh the second thing from a competitive nature one of the things i like to talk about is completely opposite to most people's opinions on the topic and it's the idea of comparing yourself to others and most people for the right reasons i think say don't compare yourself to others and i've got a different take where i directly compare myself to others all the time but i do that with my self-care in mind i don't do it in a way that's going to discourage me i do it in a way that's going to help me realize what's possible things that i never thought were possible before the specific example of that i've always shouted out like anyakubo and the coder coder and jesse from the code sector channel these are all youtube channels that were growing a lot faster than me at a certain time actually they're growing a lot faster than me right now too but i watched them like grow really really fast and i was like i've been doing this for longer i haven't seen near the amount of growth that they have what am i doing and i got really defeated about that for a while but then i started to have a little moment momentum and then i changed my goal and my perspective on that to look at like okay if they're able to get to this mark i'm gonna set that as my goal this year and i'm gonna look at what they're doing and then figure out how to help incorporate that into what i'm doing and achieve that growth never in my life would i've had a goal of reaching 100 000 subscribers on youtube last year never would have thought about that had i not seen other people do it so in that competitive nature like i directly compare myself to people all the time i do that in a way where i make sure that my self-care comes first and i don't use it as a negative but it helps me envision things that i probably never thought were possible for myself for sure so andrea why don't you go next and then brian will have you go after he does yeah sure and just continuing to james point here i think what what really matters is not not the bottom line or your metrics that you're looking at at the end of the day i see many times there are click baits quote unquote that that the community would be pushing right just for the sake of clicking when you click and just go read the tweet or read the link it's just some pushing the propaganda or something like that what really matters is are you pushing a meaningful content which can add somebody's purpose or which can help somebody as some someone was mentioning are you really helping someone if you like that then it's good to be a developer um that's that's the first i would say um point to consider whether you like to push meaningful content and whether you really like to help somebody rather than just getting your metrics or your followers or number of clicks that's that's all secondary it just comes when you add value to the community yeah i agree with that for sure brian do you want to jump in you got a question i i definitely agree with indra just shared there like it's something that tends to happen in this type of role of like you know you know we talk about vanity metrics getting caught up in that and like what are the trends on things like brazil was talking about tick tock before it's you kind of don't want to get caught up in that because you're per you if you focus on your purpose of what why you're on the platform and stuff like that um but my thing was more so uh back to what james was saying i wanted to ask him and anybody else's feeling because like i feel like for me i've struggled in the past with i've had moments where i've had that mentality of like yes let me i see these people that are doing really well and that's like that's showing the the possibilities that i could potentially attain in my own way right but uh but then there's times where i still find myself getting caught up in that comparison in a negative way and so what like i feel like maybe there's stages to getting to that so my question really is like james how did you get to that mentality so that we can all learn to do the same because right now i feel like i'm still in this stage of like i need to put my blinders on and just focus on me and how i can compete with myself my you know i mean i can get better that way some of my personal confidence and a lot of different things where i am in my career just comes from experience and that's not an experience that you don't have like i think we're at a pretty similar stage in our careers but the reality of what i said is like that's my motivational side of like what i want to communicate of how it can be good the reality is like i still struggle with that every day too like i'm going through a dip in youtube personally that's like i just messaged my wife earlier i'm like i feel like i can't do anything right on youtube no video every video is doing worse than the video before and it's like a terrible spot for me right now on youtube specifically so the reality is like that's a really hard balance for me right now i'm just feeling like damn i don't know what i'm not doing i don't know what's wrong but this really sucks it makes me not want to do my next video in some ways it makes me want to do my next video even more because i want to have another chance to do better so it's definitely balanced i don't think that thing goes away i think the the thing to encourage people to practice and this is a practice thing is recognizing when you start to use that as negative and then maybe distance yourself from it i don't think there's anything wrong with like recognizing that's not beneficial for you at this time and then backing away from it and when you're in a more like positive mindset or you have other positive things going on go ahead and capitalize on that and now start to look at like what else is possible from other people and start to internalize that and build on it when you have that level of positivity but all the all the motivational things that i have all the motivational things that i tell myself they come in ways but i do try really intentionally to continue to tell myself the positive things especially when i'm really down and i think that's a hard thing that a lot of people haven't i think that's a lot of something that a lot of other people struggle more than i do because i just force myself to say it doesn't necessarily change things overnight but i try to keep that keep that positive intention even when things start to get seeming super negative yeah i think when you when we think about like our careers and even our lives in general like you said like there's ebbs and flows right like there's the good days and the bad days and i think the struggle of what we need to try to do is try to figure out well how can we take that negative energy and turn it into positive energy right like how can we take that like that anxiety and turn it into motivation and be like okay well my video didn't do this well this week i'm gonna try harder to do the next one or my teammates are writing more blog posts to me like how can i like you know do something to to show my value does that make sense right but that's always a very hard thing to do um let's go with we're going to do tech rally next and then rizzo i'll see you got your hand up i'll have you go in right after hey uh thanks for having me out this is just a i've been a software engineer for a bit now and it's pretty kind of straightforward in terms of what i need to get done and how i get evaluated how as a developer advocate i know you guys were talking about like vanity metrics and all those things like how important is that in terms of like getting raises or promotions and all those things because it sounds like that's a pretty difficult way to and a lot of pressure for an individual to be responsible for because that there's like a level of like marketing and all that stuff that is not really um i feel like you could hire people for that kind of aspects of it like if you're just responsible for pure content and then someone else is responsible so for somehow marketing like i think that'll make life a lot easier but i'd be curious um if that is also something that is measured against you and if it is like how do you deal with that type of pressure yeah i see you put your hand up i'm guessing it's for that question do you want to go ahead and take a shot at answering it yeah and i think this also plays into a struggle where the answer is always it depends um and i'm so annoyed with that answer because anytime i have a question the answer is always well it depends it's like no it doesn't depend like there's an answer to it and my answer to this is determined by your company some companies will focus on your clout and some companies will focus on your effectiveness and i think you choosing where you want to work will be dependent on that now obviously the bottom line is what's going to matter at the end of the day if like you're creating all this stuff and then you know we see it all the time advocate gets a big following advocate besides being an advocate for the company isn't as effective as going independent doing the independent thing advocate leaves company and does the independent thing some companies want that some companies need that they need a face to associate with their brand other companies are not here for that so i think in terms of vanity metrics i think they're always going to be metrics that make people get excited make people get happy but at the end of the day depending on the company that you work for your metrics versus their metrics will always matter where i'm at now i'm not even thinking about what i'm doing personally because my personal brand has always been help one-on-one reach one reach one if i reach one i can reach talent i just have to do it one at a time and they'll go out and do the same thing but in terms of the content that i'm creating i'm having to think about it from the perspective of if i reach one person on this i'm gonna lose my job so let me start to think about how i reach more than one and and that means that the company can own that content i don't need that it's not my brand it's not my style so i think in terms of measuring your metrics it is going to depend on the company that you work for some will want you to just build your brand and do your thing some will say honestly if you're just another advocate on the team and the numbers keep going up for us we don't really care what's happening in your world uh rosella i know you had your hand up for a long time i didn't forget about you so did you have something that you wanted to ask or jump in with um it was it was like the the conversation passed it was about the the competition thing um that brian was asking about and how to keep a healthy mindset i was only going to add that i normally make my quote-unquote competition be someone that i can i know i can't reach that goal like let's say i'm like oh i want to be like angie jones she's light years ahead of me i'm not going to be at that level but i'm just like slowly trying to crawl up to that level if that makes any sense but i'd like us to go back to the the other conversation so don't worry about me no it's all good man like i just want to make sure everyone gets their moment to make whatever question and make whatever statement they need to make uh dk i see you got your hand up do you have a question or something you want to talk about um i do so thank you guys for hosting this space um i happened to just see it yesterday a little bit of background about me is i'm a brand new developer advocate like i literally hit a month yesterday i'm at a company i'm the first developer advocate so there's no program no mentorship um my boss is a product manager with no development background um so with all that being said i've spent a lot of time kind of understanding what they actually needed um from a developer advocate and like what made them kind of look for one in the first place um so now that i'm they i'm here where i'm like okay i have a place i know i can start at um i'm currently like doing a lot of research just kind of looking at other developer advocates and wanted to know um do you guys have one do you guys have mentors outside of your job i know a lot of you are at bigger companies who have established programs um so you may have like a mentor within your company um but do you have mentors outside of you know or developer relation mentors outside of your office your job and do you know of any like conferences or meetups for people like me who may be at like smaller companies with no program in existence brazil you want to you want to jump in yeah i would say if you haven't already you should join the devrel collective slack um because i do have a mentor outside of my job because i just wanted to see like what are other companies doing like i don't want to only be in like the github devrel mindset like if i go to a different company i want to know how they're approaching things so the reason why i mentioned the slack is because they have a channel called mentorship and i just like wrote in the slack and i was like hey can anyone mentor me and people responded so that's one suggestion all right uh jay and then james do you want to go after that yeah coming in one one of my mentors is posting this call so uh thank you for that uh and and sometimes i think that there can be a [Music] unspoken mentorship like hey i look at you as a mentor i use the term like big bro big sister i'm like um that is that has been helpful to me and i think a lot of that has been looking at i mean we all at some point we all want to be at the top you know principal advocate you know advocate manager director deborah like all those things but i think figuring out where you you really want to enjoy your time or you really want to get into a spot and you know james mentioned looking to people that drive him to get to that point i think in a way like having those people be your mentors um i i'm open when i say like you know b dougie is a mentor to me like there's not at least a month that goes about right i'll just paint him and be like hey here's what i'm working on here's what i'm thinking about here are the things i'm seeing in the industry here's how i feel about them but say you and luckily the community is pretty dope at least the community of like black developer advocates that i know that i affiliate with it seems like everybody is pretty on board to helping one another helping each other grow up until they get stronger um that being said i think that having someone that having someone that has a lot of your experiences uh and you know the phrase lived experiences and there's someone that that reminds you of you or where you want to be in the future is a great spot for a mentor but even if they don't have time to set up okay let's do a monthly zoom call like just let them know hey i see what you're doing i really want to like pick your brain sometimes you got a chance but if not just allow me to sit there and watch what you're doing and learn from that but also leave that invitation open so that they can hopefully build that mentorship and build those relationships because you know you're just starting out it's it's going to get real fun um but it only gets fun if you have people there to help you keep it fun and make it fun yeah i agree with that 100 uh james you got your hand up yeah i'll try to be quick um super reinforced the whole idea that like your mentor does not need to formally be a person they don't even need to know that you're a mentor i've got a million different mentors out there people that i look up to and i just pay attention to what they do like you said you've already been doing oh the first thing i meant to mention is congratulations on the new role by the way i saw you post about that and i followed you on twitter and youtube and i'm looking forward to your journey and content but there's plenty of mentor opportunities out there don't think that it has to be that formal one-on-one meeting every x number of months or whatever just like jay said um the second thing is never be afraid to ask be respectful of people's time understand that like people don't necessarily have the time to do it all but always ask and show appreciation the last thing i don't have any specific like conferences to recommend to you because i don't know enough about like your interest in uh what's going to be beneficial to you and your company but the thing i would say is just take advantage of the in-person time as best you can like i've been to a few conferences recently especially after being at home during covert for the last couple years and being in person with those people that you look up to is literally game changing like i get so much inspiration from just talking to the people that are around me in person and just the conversations that we have i'll walk away with so much inspiration like i said so much excitement so much uh that i could that i feel like i can bring back to my job on a daily basis so absolutely just take advantage of those in-person opportunities when they come along yeah for sure 100 agree with you too james um so folks thank you all for being here with uh switzer's twitter space um i do apologize again for the that brief pause in the middle where we had a little bit of technical difficulties but you know it wouldn't be an internet if stuff didn't happen um i want to say a huge thanks to our panel um i really feel like this conversation is getting super juicy right now but we do have to you know respect the time of everyone that's here and you know let them get back to their day jobs um definitely want to recommend you all follow our panel on twitter um if you're not already like go ahead and click the head little handles and stuff like that make sure you follow them make sure you check out like their youtube videos and their courses and some of the other cool things that they're doing and um and also too just before we leave i'm just gonna go around the room really quick and and give each of our folks a chance to maybe promote and talk about some of the cool things that they're doing so jay why don't i start with you and then we'll just kind of go around yeah so i just launched kind of a or relaunched a passion project of mine called diversity diversityorgs.tech think of it as a way for folks to connect with folks like them in their area in the tech space it's still rough around the edges it's still in beta i would love for people to try it out just search in your area search for the things you like uh as long as they're technically adjacent but hopefully you'll be following that story uh as i talk about deploying that on azure which is you know how i how i get paid so yeah diversity uh diversityorgs.tech is the site awesome brazil you want to go next oh dang i was trying to think of something um i i say go follow at gcodehouse on twitter um that's an organization that i work with that teaches women of color and non-very binary people of color to code um and i've been involved in it for like over three years so yeah also too i want to recommend folks go and follow result on dev.2. she writes a ton of cool articles she's not going to tell you but i'm going to tell you she writes a ton of dope stuff on on dev.2 um she wrote one just yesterday talking about some of her struggles as well as the developer advocates again definitely make sure you go ahead and check that out uh brian clark my friend you want to go next i got nothing to really promote i'm just happy to be here appreciate the conversation and uh and thanks maybe we can do another one sometime i love it man i love it it's all good um james sir you got anything you got i know you got tons of stuff going on man what do you what do you got i'm gonna start with uh plug in brian's tick tock since he didn't plug anything for himself i don't know if you posted much recently but uh his tick tock stuff is fun so go and follow him on tick tock um i run a podcast called compressed fm uh where my co-host and i amy dutton talk about web development and design so if you're interested in any of those things go and check it out at compressed.fm awesome and do i have anything to talk about i don't think i do oh please follow the stripe dev um youtube channel and also our twitter handle if you haven't already we are creating tons of cool awesome videos around payments and things of that nature uh but more importantly i do think this conversation could go on a lot longer so if folks are interested in us doing more we're continuing this conversation and talking about like some of the things that developer advocates have to face and deal with why don't you go ahead and give us a thumbs up let us know that you're still there let us know if you're still interested and let us know if this may or may not be something that you want to you want to talk about again in the future but with that being said um i think we're pretty much done right so thank you again for our panel thank all of you that are here that have been listening to us really appreciate it and uh we'll see you again for another stripe deadlife bye everybody\", metadata={'source': '03F_I8Rxfwc', 'title': 'StripeDev Live: Struggles of a developer

Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"in this video we're going to be using the details from our checkout session to display a custom order confirmation page to our customer after they've completed payment and have been redirected back to our site now we'll be building on top of code that was generated using the checkout quickstart integration builder if you don't already have this code you can find links in this video's description to the quick start and also to other videos inside of the series let's quickly review our application inside of our code we have a route called create checkout session that's called whenever our customer clicks the checkout button on our checkout.html page this route generates the underlying checkout session object that redirects our customer to stripes hosted checkout when the customer completes payment they are redirected back to the success.html file which at the moment is really just the static html page what we're going to do is change that and use the information that we get from the checkout session object to display a more customized page back inside of our checkout controller the first thing that we're going to want to do is update our success url what we're doing here is adding the session id to that route so whenever our user gets redirected to that page it'll have the id for the checkout session that we could use to get more information about what happened back in our code i'm going to add a javascript file called success.js and a script tag referencing it from success.html inside the javascript file we'll use the session id we received as a url parameter and pass it back to the backend via the order info route inside of our controller we can see the order info route will take a session id parameter and use it with the session service class to make an api call to retrieve the session object now the session object does not contain the customer data by default so using the session get options class we'll set the expand property so our request will include the customer information this is a very useful technique as it saves us from having to make multiple api calls now let's test this out on the server what i'm going to do is test this out right inside of the browser so i'm just going to go ahead and update this route call it order info and as you can see here our results are returned so we know that order info route is working let's go back to our success.html file and add some markup to display the information i'm going to give my section element a class of order info and i'll add some list elements also for this example i'm going to display the name and email address of the customer the order total and also the payment status next we'll need to style this up a little bit so instead of my style.css file i'm going to add some class specific styles i'll set the height and the list style for the unordered list to be none i'll remove the flex style from the paragraph so it spans the whole width of the section and lastly i'll center the header at the top now let's go back to our success.jss file we'll update the javascript to insert the customer and order information into the html that we just wrote to get started i created a helper function set text that will update the content of the given element i'll use this to display the name and email address from the customer object in the session if i don't have the customer object i can also pull the email from the session itself next i'll display the payment status attribute from the session object to display the readable order total i'll start by creating a currency formatter set to the session currency payment amounts are expressed using the smallest unit for the currency our price is in dollars so the amount total will be returned to us in cents because of that we'll need to divide by 100. now if we head back to our success page and we refresh we'll see that it's displaying order specific information instead of the old static page let's quickly review what we've done so far we appended the checkout session id template to the success url attribute we passed in when we created our checkout session this gave us access to the session id when our customer was redirected after completing checkout we took the id send it back to our server and made an api call to get the checkout session and also the associated customer we use this information in these objects to display a customized page if we go through our checkout floor one more time we can see that our cancel page is also static it might be a good idea if we allow our customers to return to their checkout session from this page we can do this by adding the checkout session template variable to our cancel url just like we did for our success url now if we head over to the cancel.html i'm going to add a form button that will allow us to return a checkout by default we'll set the action of the form to create a new checkout session in the event that someone lands on this page and there's no session id in the url we'll also add a little bit of javascript to the page to grab the session id from the url and change the form action to a new route which takes the id as a parameter if we head back over to our controller we're going to add a new route called return to checkout session and it's going to take the session id as a parameter it'll retrieve the associated session object and then it'll redirect the customer to checkout using the session url let's go through the checkout floor one more time i'm going to return to our session page i'm going to hit checkout if i cancel it now you see we have this button that says return to checkout if i click it now i should be able to fill out the form and on completing this form we should get redirected back to our success page thanks so much for watching and i do hope that you found this video useful if you want to learn more about checkout make sure you check out the resources inside of

to cancel a reader action so that you can cancel in-flight payment now this is part of a longer series so if you haven't seen our previous episodes on collecting payments listing readers or registering and connecting to readers check those out first otherwise you can follow along by cloning the github repo below let's get started [Music] sometimes a customer will decide that they want to buy one less thing and that means we need to be able to reset the transaction on the reader and inside of our application and then try a new payment and send that to the reader instead to do this we'll be adding functionality to the cancel button as before we'll hop into server.js for our express server and create a route this route is going to be for canceling a reader action this will expect a reader id from the request body which will then send to stripe using the cancel action method once this returns we'll send back our new reader object at the same time the physical reader will return to its idle state on the front end we'll update the cancel action click handler for our cancel button so that it uses the cancel action endpoint we just created we'll also add a message and reset the application state now when we try our application if we click on process we can cancel the action and it will reset our reader and reset the reader object that represents what's happening on the reader one thing to know about the cancel action is that while it resets the reader it does not actually cancel the payment so if you click process to hand off a payment to the reader and the customer does not actually tap their card you can click cancel and you can effectively cancel the payment however the cancel button and the cancel action only affects the reader does not actually cancel the payment directly so if a user were to actually tap their card and you click cancel the only thing it will do is reset the reader if you go look at the payment the payment will be uncaptured or completed if you actually want to cancel the payment you will need to actually cancel it with the payment intent api and we'll talk about that in a future episode but for now just know that canceling only cancels actions for the reader it does not actually cancel the underlying payment incentive you need to use the dashboard as you see here or the api to do that you\", metadata={'source':

you might know that you can retrieve resources like customers and payment attempts from the api by listing them and if you need more resources you can page through that data using pagination you might even have used the really useful auto pagination features from one of our client libraries depending on your use case you may have been looking for particular customers or payment intents based on their attributes like email or currency well now there's a way to search for those resources without listing and iterating using the new search api the search api allows you to search directly for the resources that you're interested in in one api call by passing a query to the api paging through search results is possible and our client libraries also support auto pagination for search results in this dev by you'll learn how to query the api about the fundamental operators like exact matching and substring matching and combining filters using boolean operators let's take a look [Music] let's start with a very simple search query we'll search for all payment intents in a particular currency in this case let's search for payment intents in euros i'm using ruby for this example but you could use any of our officially maintained striped client libraries we're printing out the data array which is the list of results from the search if we scroll up we can see a list of payment intents let's look at the parts of this query a query is made up of one or more clauses clauses of combination of a field an operator and a value in this simple case the field is the currency the colon is our exact match operator and the value is the string e u r for euros so that we're not always looking at so much data let's print out the values that we're interested in in this case let's grab the id amount and currency you can search for values that are nested in objects too payment intents are state machines that produce charges so let's search for charges that used a specific card last four number so now we have all charges that used to that 4242 card let's try out searching for results using a compound query with multiple clauses we'll search for charges that use the card with last4 of 4242 or 3155 now we have a data set including charges that use the card with last 4 of 4242 or 3155 negation of clauses is also supported by using the minus operator let's search for all payments that use the 4242 card and aren't in euros so now we have all non-euro charges for that card when using multiple query clauses and is the default so it can be excluded if you like let's look at string matching we'll search for customers with an exact match of their email address notice that we have to escape the quotes in the string when passing it as a value using single quotes there the customer jenny rosen has that email address but we can also search using the substring operator which is the tilde character we'll search for anybody who has jenny in their email address there are two customers with that substring in their email let's take a moment to look at field types now that we've experimented with exact matches string matches and substring matches there are three types of field token string and numeric if a field type is token it's used for exact matches disregarding the case strings can be matched exactly under substrings which we've just seen and finally numeric field types can be matched exactly but also using greater than or less than logic there's too many to cover now but the docs list every field that can be searched and its type let's do some numeric searches we'll go back to payment intents and search for those that are over a certain amount we'll take 10 euros in stripe amounts are represented in the smallest currency denominations so therefore 10 euros or dollars is 1 000 cents nice we have all payment intents over 10 euros greater than and less than can also be combined with equals let's get all payment intents that are greater than or equal to 10 euros metadata on searchable objects is also supported so you can now search for arbitrary key value data that you store on your objects let's search for all payment intents that matched metadata where i stored a key in value of foo and bar and just like other attributes we can combine clauses for metadata you can also query for the presence of a metadata key on an object using the minus operator and the special value of null for example the following clause would match all records where foo is a metadata key so now you're fully equipped to start using the search api to build custom queries for your system you could leverage the api for example to build a custom dashboard for searching for charges based on status or finding customers by email for support cases and much more you can search for charges customers invoices payment intents prices products and subscriptions and searches available in all of our official stripe client libraries a note on versioning search is supported on api versions 202027 or higher with a new search api you have a rich query interface to your stripe resources this empowers you to build new solutions and interfaces that will streamline your processes and help to build your business if you have any questions feedback queries don't hesitate to reach out to us at stripedv on twitter or join in the conversation on our discord server

experience of stripe apps and explore some of the more common components of the ui extensions sdk if you don't already have an app running remember to start it with the command stripe apps start and follow the prompt to run in the stripe dashboard let's navigate over to our hello world viewport which is in the customer detail page and then we have our app running now let's start with a quick overview of the more common components by diving into the code every stripe app should have a context view component at its root you can use this component to display some information about your app such as a title description and an external link to your site or docs let's start fresh and remove all the contents of this context view and build our own functionality after saving this tsx file let's switch back to the browser and we'll see the app there has updated to reflect our changes stripe apps has the same hop module reloading experience you'd expect from a modern front-end framework similarly any errors will be displayed in both the browser and your terminal window you might have noticed that contextview comes with the props user context and environment these contain information about the stripe accounts the app is running on and data about the environment let's use some of context fuse props to show off some of the details in these variables we'll use the description and banner props to show the account id and customer id let's start by adding to our context view some additional props we'll add a description and in here we're going to add let's say the account id so we'll say account is equal to usercontext.account.id let's save this see what this looks like there we go we have our account id is listed there and then next let's show a banner so what i'm going to do is type banner equals and this is going to be some jsx i'm going to return i want to add a banner which i'll add here it's going to be the type default i'll give it the title of customer and the description is going to be our environment object context dot id i'm going to make sure in case this is null and that is going to be the end of our banner component let's save go back to our app and here we see we have the customer id as well next let's add interaction like some data we want to capture the best way to do that is with a focus view which allows you to open a dedicated focus space that is ideal for data input let's add the focus view in a button that triggers the opening of that view by editing some state we unless you set up a react's use state hook so let's first create some states we'll say const show data input set show data input equals use state which is going to have a default or type of boolean most of the default defaults next within our context field we want a button we'll tab it the type of primary so that it stands out a bit more and we'll have an on press function now we unpress we want to say set show data input to true and then within the button we'll call this add item like so let's save there we have our button of course when we click it it'll send some states but it won't be reflected in the eui anywhere so let's change that on the default button let's add a focus view the focus view is going to have a title of data input we need a property shown which determines whether we want to show the focus view or not and here we'll simply use show data input the variable we created earlier and finally we did an unclose function for now this is what will trigger when you click the x button the top right of the focus view and here we'll just say shut show data inputs to false let's close our focus view and we'll leave it empty just for now let's save this go back to our app click add item and here we have our focus view but of course we can't do anything with it yet because it's pretty empty but at least we didn't know that if you click the x button it should close and you can reopen it now let's populate our focus view with a text area we'll add a label and an area label for accessibility when you add data into the text area we'll automatically save a new state new item so let's start with creating our state of new item and set new item which is going to be using the use state hook which has type string and we'll default to an empty string now in our focus view let's add a text area we'll give it the label of add new item we'll give it an area label because accessibility is very important of add new item as well add a placeholder enter new item and an unchanged function so the ontreat function is going to take an event and here we're going to use our state setter we just created which is set new item e dot target dot value and then we'll self close this text area let's go check it out let's click add item and here we have a little text area so we can type stuff in here which will change the state but we have no way of actually saving it yet so let's fix that we'll go back to our code and within our focus view let's also add primary action and secondary action props to our focus view these will control the save and cancel actions in our view so let's start with a primary action which is going to take some jsx in here we'll add a button which will set the type to primary because you want this to draw the most attention we'll have an on umpress in here we want to call a function called add new item which doesn't actually exist yet but that's okay we'll just step this out then in here we want to say have this button say save next we want a secondary action which is going to look very similar we're going to have a button this time it'll just remain the default we'll just have an on press prop and in here it's quite simply we want to close the focus view so we'll say set show data inputs defaults and this will just be a cancel button so let's save this go back to our code add item here we have our cancel and save button nicely positioned in the bottom right hand corner with a nice color for save and a default color for cancel so clicking cancel should just return me back to the main page but clicking save doesn't do anything just yet because we don't have this add new item function so let's do something about that let's say const add new item equals this function so now we have this data what should we do with it let's use it to build a list of items now let's use some new state something called items to be able to capture the new state we'll capture the new items so we'll say this is use state and this is going to be type an array of strings this will default to an empty array in add new item let's say set items items dot concat new item let's clean up after ourselves by saying set show date input to false to close the focus view and set new item back to empty string so now we have that data let's do something with it let's add a list of items to our state that way we can use that to populate the list component of list items going here underneath our focus view let's add a list we'll give it an aria label prop which we'll say is list of data and inside list let's map over our items and i think we'll need the index as well and we'll return a list item component inside this list item we'll give it a title would this be the item itself we'll give it a key which will use the index and we'll close off this component let's save that go back to our to our app let's say let's add an item we'll say new item one click save there we have that let's try another one just for sure to make sure it works new item two click save now we have our second item and there we have it a super simple app that takes some data and renders it in a list so that was a quick intro to some of the more common components included in the ui extensions sdk you can learn more about the components highlighted here and the many other components in the stripe app docs thanks for watching [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'PfG97u0k7L8', 'title': 'Stripe Apps 101 - 02

You create a subscription whenever you wanna sell\\na customer a product with a recurring price. When you create a recurring price, you specify how often to build a customer, like weekly, monthly, yearly,\\nor at custom intervals. At the end of each interval, Stripe sends the customer an invoice. If your customer has a balance\\nand a defined payment method, you can also choose to\\nautomatically charge them or send them an invoice. Stripe offers a few\\ndifferent integration options from the Dashboard, No-code, you could create a product\\ncatalog and use payment links to easily share recurring\\nproducts with your customers and let them set up subscriptions. With the Customer Portal, your customers can manage\\ntheir billing information and subscriptions on a Stripe-hosted page. If you write a little code, you can use Stripe Checkout\\nto build an integration that redirects to a Stripe-hosted page. You just need to add some\\nbuttons to your website. For a fully customizable user experience, you can build an integration\\nwith Stripe Elements. Stripe Billing makes it easy to represent your business on Stripe, whether you have one product, a good-better-best model with\\ndifferent tiers of service, usage-based or tiered pricing, or other advanced pricing models. You can also set up free trials, offer discounts, for example, on a yearly, as opposed to a monthly subscription; upgrade and downgrade subscriptions; and even manage operations. Related products, like\\nrevenue recognition, can help you understand your\\nrecurring revenue model. Stripe produces a variety of reports that help you understand when to recognize or defer recurring revenue and close your books at\\nthe end of the quarter. Revenue recovery features, like Smart Retries and Reminder Emails, help you capture more revenue. And Stripe Tax automatically\\ncalculate sales tax based on your customer's location. Before you go live,\\nyou can use test clocks and other testing tools to test and confirm that your\\nrecurring billing integration supports your business and works exactly like you want it to.

you'd like to watch a deep dive video on the stripes cli you can find a link in the description let's take a moment though to recap on some of the great features you can use to drive your development process you can via the command line use the stripe cli to list retrieve create and update many different types of resources like payment intents charges customers and checkout sessions to name a few you can also use the cli to tell the logs in your account so that you can see in real time the calls that your system is making and you can even create your own sophisticated fixtures and now the stripe cli is available for testing directly in the stripe docs known as the stripe shell since stripe shell runs in the browser there are a couple of features that are only available in the command line interface but being able to trigger events listen to events in your account and query and manipulate resources from anywhere in the stripe docs is immensely powerful so let's take a look [Music] the first thing to check is that you're signed into your stripe account you can see this when you navigate to the stripe docs and check the top right corner if you're signed in you'll see the name of your stripe account there once you've made sure that you're signed in there's two ways to invoke the stripe shell firstly you can navigate to the stripe cli docs under development tools there you'll see a button labeled try it online if you click the button the shell will appear if you're logged in you can invoke the shell from anywhere inside the docs using the keyboard shortcut control and backtick for example if i happen to be on the docs homepage and i'd like to access the shell i can simply hit control back tick to open it let's start experimenting one of the main features of the shell is that it allows you to learn experiment and manage resources in your account so let's start with listing payment intents on our account you'll notice that the shell will auto-complete as you type you can hit tab to iterate through the options listed below and hit enter to select the currently highlighted option and you can also click on the autocomplete options to add it to your command this is a brand new account so as expected we don't have any payment intents so let's use the shell to create one the required fields are listed at the top so let's provide an amount and a currency list again and see what we get if we expand the first and only element in the data array we can see our new payment intent what if we made a mistake though and are charging the customer too much we need to update it so let's go and do that we'll click on the clipboard icon next to the payment intent id then let's update the payment attempt to charge only 10 euros before we do that though since the update command will take a payment intent id let's check the format of that command by using the help argument for update it seems like we passed the payment intent id and then the parameters so let's go ahead and update the amount we can already see in the response the amount of the payment intent has been updated to 10 euros let's verify that in the dashboard there we have it we've created and updated a payment intent with just a few keystrokes right in the browser let's jump into the docs for interacting with the api notice in the code snippets there's commands for the stripe cli i can copy that code snippet and run it directly here in the shell as i'm reading through the dock or if you see the green play button next to a stripe cli command you can simply click it and it will automatically run that command in the shell so now you're already equipped to start to experiment and manage apr resources using the stripe shell let's experiment with events in our system we'll start by splitting the shell into two panes in the first pane let's call stripe listen to listener events in our account and in the second let's create a payment intent cool we can see that the shell is listening for the exact event that we expect when creating a payment intent you might know this from the stripes cli but it's also possible to trigger specific events too let's trigger the payment intent succeeded event again you can see that autocomplete is immensely helpful here you might notice that we receive multiple events in our pane that's listening that's because the payment intent succeeding also creates a charge object so we see all of the related events while the browser shell cannot forward events to your local development server it's still possible to use other tunneling software like ngrok to tunnel events from your stripe account to your local dev machine and trigger those events from the shell in my case i've set up a tunnel and i'm using that to send webhook events from my stripe account to my local dev machine this is so useful when building and testing a web hook endpoint on your local machine i'm running a super simple sinatra app locally which will echo when certain event types are posted at the endpoint so let's go ahead and trigger a payment intent succeeded event in the shell nice and there you have it now you can trigger events from the shell and develop your webhook endpoint code locally and react and fulfill orders if you installed the native stripe cli you would be able to start an event listener on the command line and forward those events to your local dev machine all in one command without having to configure a webhook endpoint in the dashboard so we do highly recommend installing that for your development tool chain finally if you're a vs code user you can install the stripe vs code extension and listen for events trigger events tell your logs and much more all integrated right into vs code this extension is underpinned by the stripe cli the stripe cli is an essential tool that you can use to develop and test your stripe integration it's available as a standalone command line tool integrated as an extension with vs code and now it's available right inside the browser with stripe shell we hope you enjoyed this short introduction to striped shell if you have any questions comments or feedback

payments and recurrence subscriptions with just a few clicks and now payment links are integrated on zapier to talk more about how to use payment links to share payment pages anywhere you'd like whether it's social media text or email i am joined by cass a software engineer on the zapier team thanks for joining cass thanks charles all right cass so what is zapier zapier lets you automate tasks with no code it connects together over four thousand apps like facebook slack google sheets uh to help you handle lead management build marketing automation workflows create reconciliation flows and more some of the popular ways to use zapier include getting notified about a new purchase keeping track of data by logging into a spreadsheet for future tasks like fulfillment or an email newsletter we work with businesses of all sizes from solopreneurs standing up their first product to whole companies building internal tools for the entire team that's super cool so how do you actually build an automation with zapier what are the pieces and parts and steps and such it's pretty simple to automate tasks on zapier we call it building zaps you're essentially telling apps to follow a simple command when this happens do this every zap has a trigger and one or more actions a trigger is an event that starts as app and an action is then what your zap does for example as a simple overview we'll cover it in more depth soon new payment links can be automatically created when a row is added in air table the trigger is the new air table row and the action is a new payment link oh that's super cool so since we know what we can do with payment links and zapier and it sounds like there are tons and tons of possibilities um let's actually try it out so i have my air table here which for those who haven't used air table it's a bit between a database and a spreadsheet and this is where i'm managing a product catalog of limited edition t-shirts so here i have all of my product information my product name an image a description a price and a last updated tag as well as a column of where a payment link would go and so our goal is going to be to create a zapier integration that automatically adds a payment link whenever we add a row to this product catalog first step we're going to just hop on over to zapier and we have no zaps yet so i'm going to create a zap and uh trigger like you said uh trigger's the first part of my zap so i guess i would start with uh air table and with this air table i would like to trigger it every time a new record is created okay so i'm going to grab my base and limited edition t-shirts my product catalog and my limited view now when i test this trigger it's pulling my actual product information this is coming directly from air table let's see here and if i go to my record so i'm just going to pick this one this represents the first row i think so i'll click continue and then for my next step i'm going to click stripe beta at the time of this video if you want to do stuff with payment links you should go to stripe beta right yes yes um this is just how we're launching the new the new app with the new features okay super cool and like you said i can create a payment link a price a product and deactivate a payment link now from the stripe side i know that in order to create a payment link you need a price and in order to create a price you need a product and in the old days you had to create all of these things in a dashboard so it's pretty neat that you can do it with zapier but we'll start by creating a product i'm going to select my stripe account which i've already authenticated and here i just need to add in my information so only the name is required and i can dynamically add the name by picking stuff from this first step of new record so i have my name i can also add in the description an image and this can be a url i believe so we'll grab the image url and the tax code so we're going to skip that for now so now i have a product and if i go ahead and click test and continue this should create a live mode version of this product and actually send it to stripe so here's a product id and if i go to stripe products i have no products now but if i refresh a product should be created and here it is this is the product that aligns with the row that i just made inside uh this row here in my limited edition t-shirt space so that's working pretty well i have a product but i have no prices so i can't sell it i just go back now i need to create my price and if i create a price here this can use the information that i made that i used when i created my product so to set up this action the first thing i'm going to need is the product that i just created so we can find that here and specifically we're going to want the id now the rest of the information is actually going to come from our base so inside of our brace we had a price and the price is currently in cents and you have to actually send it in cents and caspian a software engineer will probably tell you why it's probably pretty dangerous to do currencies with uh floats and decibels and such and then for our currency we'll set that to usd uh we could do this from our base but in some cases you can actually safely hard code stuff in an airtable base like that's totally legit right cass yeah i want to hardcore my currency uh for recurring or one time this is not a t-shirt subscription so we're going to do one time hit continue so this is going to create a price and if we click test this should create a price which means that if we go to products and we refresh we should now have a price all right so we're selling our t-shirt for a hundred dollars it's an expensive t-shirt kanye west probably made that t-shirt that's why it's so expensive okay so now we're going to create our payment link and we're going to use the price that we just created here and let's see here so here's our price our price and we can set our quantity or we can do like adjustable quantities but there's these are limited editions so you can only buy one we can set collect tax automatically to true but it's exclusive anyway um we can choose to allow promotion codes but we haven't set anything up and also it wouldn't really make sense to have uh promotion codes for a limited edition t-shirt now in terms of collecting addresses and shipping addresses that is important for fulfillment so we'll select that and uh for allowed countries we're just gonna do the united states we can actually do multiple options here as long as it's comma delimited it seems and then the phone number we can select true or false but for our use case we don't actually need it and then finally when it comes to payment links you have the opportunity to either show a confirmation page that's hosted on the stripe payment page or redirect back to your site in my case i don't have a website so i'm just going to show a confirmation page and i can put in a nice semi-dynamic message like thank you for purchasing and then we can add in the name of the product so product name this product name and right now it's the original henley shirt number one but if this zap were to run on a different product i think it would show a different name this is all dynamic right this name is dynamic i can actually kind of have something like a template like this exactly yeah that's all dynamic so this is like showing you to give you confidence of what the data would look like when the zap ran but when the zap actually runs it's all totally dynamic whatever info is in the air table will be what comes through to all these stripe steps oh that's awesome okay so let's give this a shot here let's create this payment link and we're gonna click test and continue and this should create a payment link inside of stripe and it has i can actually we can actually see the link here so this is a live mode payment link here so you can see we have our product page which i've made zapier orange on one side you can do those type of custom customizations in the stripe dashboard we have all the product information from our zap including the product name the image the description the price so the last thing we have to do is actually put our payment link in our base so we'll do air table i'm pretty sure update record okay we'll pick our air table and if i wanted to actually like backfill this flow um is there an option to do that like i know i can kind of trigger it now but if i needed to backfill it is that actually possible with a zap what do you mean by backfill well right now i have two rows so i have this row and i have that row and right now i'm i'm using zapier to test this row um row number one i'm thinking that like for this action i'm gonna i need to update the payment link so if i go to payment link and i update it i can add in my actual payment link url if i can find it let's see oh i have to pick my record my original airtable record should show somewhere in here uh yeah that's the right id so what i meant by backfill is right now i think that if i hit test and continue this record was sent to airtable so this last one should update the record so that it updates the row from step one to have the payment link so i'm going to hop in over here and it does right and that's great so by backfill what i meant was that is there a way for me to automatically get this one in all of the existing rows to have payment links too because i've already added it in my payment link my zap years app is only running every time i add a new record but i have this old record and i want to run it too right that's what i meant by yeah okay uh yeah once you so once you turn a zap on it will dynamically get all the data so really you want to sort of turn this up on before you start having these flows so as soon as you know you're selling limited edition t-shirts you'd want to create that zap so it just captures all the information in real time as the products are added um we do have a product called transfer uh that's fairly new that was released recently from zapier and that one has sort of more backfill compatibility that you're talking about to be able to go through and update historical data as opposed to um zapier in in throughout history has only really done um real-time data from the time of when you turn the zap on so yes you can check out uh check out transfer if you wanted to try out backfilling backfilling that data essentially it's sort of like a zap but it runs for all previous data that already exists in air table as opposed to the next piece of data and then you can obviously combine that so you can do the historical backfill and then have your zap on to also capture future future products oh awesome i'll have to check out transfers but it is possible so let's let's give it a let's uh let's turn this on like this works i could i could do this let's see i'll just i'll just run it on both just to be safe awesome if i go here let's see oh there it is it works this is great and i can take this app and i can just like extend it however i'd like that the case yeah if you want to go through and add extra things uh you can do that okay one last thing i said that you could share pay link payment link anywhere so i'm going to share it anyway so let's see i'm on twitter so i'm going to just create a tweet and i'm already authenticated here pretty sure so let's go ahead and add an action and let's see if this works our latest t-shirt dropped be sure to buy it here and then let's see i can probably grab my payment link url here get them while they're still there all right cool so maybe not the best copy ever and image url i put in my image url and i can shorten it okay so let's let's like tweet this out all right it's saying that to twitter that it tweeted so let's see oh there it is awesome all right so you can just add this and you can extend it uh very easily by just adding on additional steps payment links is the easiest way to get started creating a hosted payment page on stripe and now that we have zapier as an integration it is easier than ever cass thank you so much for taking the time to show us how to use zapier and payment links and thank you for helping build uh the zapier payment links integration we really appreciate it it's super awesome you're very welcome charles thanks for having me on to do this recording um and thanks to everyone else in the team who also helped build this integration for zapier so that's all for now if you're ready to get started building with zapier and stripe payment links definitely go to zapier.com and stripe.com register to get started today we can't wait to see what you build [Music]

optimized payments experience is hard. Form formatting, error\\nhandling, payment methods, there are so many things to keep in mind that even large, sophisticated\\nbusinesses make mistakes despite having entire teams devoted to the payments experience. Rather than reinventing the wheel and diverting resources\\naway from other priorities, we've built Checkout, to make it easier for businesses to offer best in class\\npayments experience, while reducing the integration\\nand maintenance effort. Checkout is our flagship integration for both e-commerce and\\nsubscription businesses. It's an optimized hosted payments page that access a natural\\nextension of your website as the domain and branding\\ncan be customized. It combines all the knowhow from our front end, design\\nand analytics teams, and it's a result of\\ncontinuous optimizations across hundreds of thousands of merchants. Conversion features are\\nbuilt in by default, like address auto complete, which it can increase conversion by 0.8% or one click payments\\nusing link with Stripe which lets returning customers\\ncheck out four X faster. Is fully responsive and\\ndesigned to work across devices with out-of-box support for\\nboth Apple Pay and Google Pay. It has powerful plug and play features to capture more revenue such\\nas adjustable quantities, cross sells of products\\nand subscription of sales. And finally it's globally optimized. That means it's localized\\nin over 25 languages and supports over dozens payment methods. Plus it is fully SCA ready and able to handle dynamic tax\\ncalculation with Stripe tax. When you use Checkout, your customers are re-redirected from your website to a\\nprebuilt payments page, which is hosted by Stripe\\nand optimized for conversion. They are then redirected\\nback to your website once they complete a transaction. Checkout drastically\\nsimplifies your integration, with few API costs and less maintenance and more out of the box optimizations. If you want to build your own payment page with full CSS level customization, you can use Stripe elements. Elements extracts some Checkout's most powerful payment features. That means you still got some of the same conversion optimizations like form formatting, access to 20 plus payment methods and stay PCI compliant. But to access more powerful\\nfeatures like promo codes, upsells, tax and subscription, you'll need to spend time\\nto build it yourself. Integrating with elements will require more engineering effort but lets you have more control over the look and feel\\nof your payments page. If you're looking to accept\\npayments without any coding, you can create a payment link\\nfrom your Stripe dashboard. Stripe payment links lets you\\ncreate a Stripe Checkout page in just a few clicks, and share our usable link to sell products or subscriptions. Let's recap what we have learned. To start accepting payments online, Stripe offers three\\npayment user interfaces. Checkout which is a prebuilt\\nhosted payments page that is optimized for conversion, elements, which is with\\nthe free UI building blocks that can be embedded on your site to create a secure payments experience. And payment links, which\\nis a no code solution. You can create a Stripe Checkout\\npage in just a few clicks and share the link with your\\ncustomers via any channel.

two really awesome guests with us today is joffrey sequez um the creator and maintainer of viewstrike and just an awesome developer overall welcome joff please tell us a little bit about yourself hey hello i hope everyone can hear me thanks church for the introduction yeah thanks for inviting me here in stripe live q a my name is joff i'm from manila i'm the creator of viewstripe and i'm currently working as the tech lead and head of front-end development for my cure so it's basically a startup company here in manila and i like open source and i have a bunch of javascript and vue.js projects that you can check out on my github and for my hobbies i do reclaiming and cycling awesome and we all we're also joined by darren who's on the software engineering team here at stripe and also an open source developer also someone who maintains quite a few projects as a maintainer and a creator darren would you introduce yourself as well yeah thanks so yeah i'm darren uh software engineer at stripe so team i'm on we handle authentication for a number of products at stripe but most notably like api keys so as it relates to vue i've been a user review since around like 2017 so i've done some work experience in view but born out of that work experience has been open sourced a few libraries most recent one being swerve so this is a viewport of a react data fetching library swr and yeah i don't do any front end stripe so that's what i'm currently at cool so just to kick things off let's say let's start with you darren can you give us a quick down just like a quick rundown of what is view for those of us that may have joined who are want to learn more about the view ecosystem in view as well sure yeah so vue.js i think if you just went to the website it would market itself as the progressive javascript framework so it's a way to create javascript apps insert interactivity into websites http websites so you're being able to progressively enhance portions of your app that you want to make more interactive with javascript and make it a little easier to do and in terms of yeah i think that's basically it yeah i think that's a great rundown it is very much like the progressive web framework you can add it as just like a script tag download it from a cdn and use it like a bit of a jquery type of situation very lightweight very easy to use so let's here's a question for both of you and let's start with joff how did you get started with vue and what was your first project yeah so basically for me it was actually more of a company directed rather than a personal choice so there was a time when we were thinking of upgrading our web apps which were made in angularjs if you can guys remember that basically we were upgraded upgrading our web apps into a newer framework and so our options back then were angular 2 and then react.js and and of course the relatively new version to pjs and yeah basically we were assigned to to do research on those frameworks and i was the one who was assigned to to do research for bjs and then yeah long story short we did a lot of benchmarking and prototyping you know all those sorts of comparisons for the three frameworks and then yeah finally we we decided to pick vjs and along with the beautify as our main css slash component library and yeah from there i got addicted to view basically yeah my first project was uh it's an internal uh web application for our company and then my first open source project for bjs was yeah it's viewstripe so i've been maintaining viewstrike for like about four years now i think awesome and what about you yeah i was about 2017 it was a job we were at php shop so i think a lot of the success that vue has had has been around like inside of the php ecosystem specifically laravel so we were maintaining a few apps that were didn't have necessarily any tied to any back-end but we did have a php back in they were looking to integrate and we did reach at first for progressive advancement where you're basically just injecting it into a few components that you want more reactive but then as we built more and more onto it this was like for a e-commerce platform like etsy so it's like an etsy type platform where we had like interactive search and different whether you're liking products etc so we were trying to make the app not have too much javascript front loaded like a single page application and we were just progressively enhancing it but we did weigh a bunch of options and vue was like at the time this was like before the composition api even so a lot of the benefits that you brought was the learning curve someone say like how do i get how do i learn react or how do i learn view as the views really just go read the docs the docs were such a powerful learning tool and they still continue to be just i think a north star for a lot of other technical projects and so because of the benefits of the docs and needing the team we were actually a team of mostly backend engineers at the time and we needed to all become full stack and at the time it seemed like front end was overwhelming or there was too many tools or you had to install a thousand dependencies but with vue it just seemed like very elegant a way to dip our toes into reactivity as it relates to like the newer frameworks that were coming out at the time and so we went with vue as a way to expedite and i think for a lot of people when they see view for the first time it says oh this makes sense it's html css and javascript and when you package it into single single file components it just clicks for a lot of people yeah that i feel like that's like a very common narrative like you're oftentimes like a end developer especially with the php laravel ecosystem um really curious to know either what the back story is about that was there like what exactly is it about laravel and vue that leads so many people to use the two together is it do either you all know the back stories of that one yeah actually that's i was also curious about that one so that i have actually the same question for for darren like i haven't really tried uh view with laravel ever because there's really no need for me too but yeah i'm just also curious how the experience yeah historically from what i understand was that view before laravel signed off onto it it was lesser known it was considered a pet project and laravel at the time taylor atwell the creator i think him and a few of their core teams this is uh this is actually a little bit of speculation so i think that they were trying to figure out like what would be the default front end for laravel because it is like a rails type framework that allows you to do the whole mvc flow of your controller so being able to pick a view layer that also has that single that single page application type interactivity being able to pick a framework that makes sense for people coming from this like old style php into laravel and then migrating them into a javascript paradigm it was at one point taylor outwell made the mid view the default like when you installed laravel because of that i think it took off in in that sphere and then it had a ripple effect through two other two other frameworks that's really interesting so that's incredibly interesting one of the things that that like both of you touched on it sounds like you started off with vue because it was like driven by a company at the decision by your company but afterwards you're both open source maintainers of different view projects several view projects so what is it about vue that kept you that captured you so that you decided to use it not only for just work projects but perhaps for like open source projects that might not be related to the things that you're doing at work why do you like view right for me it's basically the learning curve my experiences in in web development started in vanilla javascript and then i discovered jquery and then after that the angular angularjs the first version and yeah when i started to develop things in view it just like uh darren said it somehow just clicks for me and everything is is easier so i guess that's it yeah i have a similar my first job was angular and then my second job was in react and this was like right when they were introducing like some of the babble transforms to be able to do class components and it was definitely coming to view i felt there's definitely this thought behind react that it like clicks for people coming out of like functional paradigms so you're able to compose and you feel like the function the functional aspects of the programming language like javascript is it's like a first-class citizen whereas with vue that's using like proxies and having to observe side effects not in the most functional way so because of that the magic aspects of you i don't think actually like at first they seem like it's too magical oh i update this and then it fires off this whereas when react you know you're always explicitly setting state or running effects so because of that i think like the magic aspects they get in your way in some regards but for the most part they just click for the majority of use cases and then when you want to opt out of them vue has those either like jsx opt-outs to where you're actually explicitly creating jsx fragments or you're having to use some of the primitives with the composition api so in swerve you have to use a few of the i wouldn't say like not paved road methods to because it's like at the library but when you're actually developing applications you're not developing for libraries so you don't you can you have to worry about as much whereas i feel like in some of the other frameworks it's a little more verbose definitely and speaking of swerves so that's one of the larger projects that you maintain question for you both darren and joff like what are the largest view projects that open source view projects that you currently maintain and why did you build them you start where you yeah basically for me it's uh the largest project that i'm maintaining is view stripe and then i also have some collection collection of filters and directives and how i got into how i started viewstrip is also like uh similar with how i started with view so basically in my company we were asked to implement a stripe checkout for one of our products and then yeah from there at first i was i was just like developing a reusable component and then i decided to upload it to github and then suddenly some people are you're asking upgrades for the project and then i i suddenly realized that that i accidentally operated an open source project so i just went with it and upgrade everything so basically if there's a demand for an upgrade or or an addition to to the features yeah i give time for it yeah awesome man what about you there yeah like you mentioned swerve is probably my largest project it's it's a project that's still under the organization at my previous company but i continue to be the sole maintainer for it and it's it's big in the sense that i probably get the most issues for it right now i also maintain a library called view auto suggest which is a component that abstracts away some of the combo box plus like aria controls for if you want to make a auto suggest component or some autocomplete component like accessible i maintain that and that's probably the longest running one that i've maintained so it doesn't have as as many incoming issues i'm currently thinking about migrating into view three at the moment where a swerve already exists for v3 awesome so sean just asked what do you guys think of svelte which is like the i've heard that one popping up a lot so i'm really interested at which i think about that one as well i think it's really awesome so spell is this amazing framework that sort of flips the script with a lot of the things that we thought were possible with javascript and interactivity and it takes it in a way that i think is really appealing because it has that same spirit of view which is let's progressively enhance some components and let's do so in a way that is intuitive and when you read spell you're just like it's a breath of fresh air it's okay i update that and that component updates but then it also i think pushes the boundary for what the other frameworks are needing to come to grips with which is that things like composition api with vue and things like hooks and react they are they can be hard for not just beginning use cases but even medium to advanced use cases and so svel i think has this amazing ecosystem of things and view is actually borrowing from it at first people were opposed to jsx and then was felt they're opposed as they're like what's going on with this compiler this isn't even actually valid javascript like this isn't an actual method when i run it or these tokens these sigils that you have to put in front of your variables to make sure that they're reactive so views borrowing that stuff from them and i think it's it's only benefiting everyone right likewise so yeah yeah yeah likewise so i agree with so basically a funny thing is uh just this morning i was trying and trying out this belt and yeah the framework is awesome and the way they designed the things how they do the things that they are doing basically it's a lot for me it's a bit i'm getting a feeling up it's a bit like a more low level than than compared to view and tour app but definitely overall it's a great framework and i think it will go far one really interesting they think that's all about svelt recently was when you actually write libraries for view and react like a lot of times they're like react autosuggest or view stripe with with felt i was actually running into these vanilla js libraries so they were just like for anyone to implement in whatever app if you're angular what not and i was looking at a couple of recent ones like i'm trying to remember the names it was like a there's a walkthrough for like being able to see different like parts of your app like guide users to different elements and i looked under the hood and it was actually built and felt and then just compiled to javascript so with like vgs and react a lot of times you have these front loaded script tags to say well i'm using react 16 and then anything else knows about that global react but it's felt like because it compiles away you can get smaller bundles and you don't have it's not like i need spell in a script tag before i load this other library and so i thought that was really cool just like seeing it as like an engine for vanilla javascript libraries it sounds like sounds like i need to test out swell it sounds like we all need to test house there's like a lot of good stuff apparently in that framework is there anything so darren you mentioned that vue has actually picked up some things from svel having never used it myself what are some of those things that are spelt like you would say in view or probably i'm imagining it's view through yeah there's these things called reactivity transforms is what the docs refers to them as and the setup script is i think borrowed from seville because essentially when you looked at like a svelte component there's no here's the function here's the export here's the it's just here's the javascript and it just works with the template you don't have to tell the template like what you're sending it and so put up script and view allows you to just say hit the script tag you denote it with the keyword setup and then everything inside of the script tag will be exported for availability in the template then you have these things like refs so refs are a primitive inside of view that allow you to hook into the reactivity for the composition api so because of that composition api ref you have to tell the template or i'm sorry you have to tell the other functions inside of your script tag oh this is a ref so i need to actually call dot value and calling that dot value is a little cumbersome you can add a sigil to your ref instantiation via dollar sign and then view actually at compile time transform it to be something that the interpreter can handle and so you don't everything doesn't need to call dot value it just sort of like works which is as i understand it borrowed from felt i didn't know that was the thing i'm going to be using that a lot i found from like migrating from like view two to view three having to call dot value on things that you declare as reactive sometimes if you're using like an extension like i think like volar will remind you to do it or do it automatically for you but it is definitely like one of those things can occasionally trip people up speaking of the composition api and reps and things of that nature how has view changed since you started using it i would say a lot because someone who's just been using vue js for so many years now so like i i encountered the limitations for the the current options api so many times for a lot of my projects and then and just comparing it to how composition api works it's the comparison between the changes it's like uh huge so basically just from the composition api you can tell that there's really a great a big difference between the yeah this change i was part of a team that was 100 options api and then we introduced the composition beta so the composition api has a view to shim so that you can actually start using it before you migrate to v3 and so actually swerve is an options api only library it doesn't actually work with i'm sorry it's a composition only api library so it doesn't actually work with the options api so because of that you need it has a pure dependency of the composition api shim and then the there's another version or of you three explicitly and so anyway my team that we were migrating from options api to composition api that was a pretty big change for a lot of people it definitely is it's not a few like syntax updates your components change fundamentally luckily you can do it per component you don't have to it's not like a full rewrite of your app and so you can optionally hook into you can even create like wrappers around options and uh components to hook into reactivity if you need to so yeah change for the better in my opinion that's good definitely speaking of you three it sounds like you've already adopted it for some of your projects darren or at the very least like you're using the shim so that you can do the composition api with you too i'm curious are if you have view to libraries are you thinking about adopting uh view three anytime and if so what are those features that you're looking forward to when you migrate from view to the view three and we can start with yuja right yeah so definitely yes i would i would love to migrate my projects into v3 because as far as i know the default for view now is the version three right so i think it's inevitable to to move from view to view three but yeah the plans are to migrate little by little and then uh maybe for view stripe i'm thinking of creating a separately new version for a view for version three of view js and then we'll just have the viewer version exists alongside with the new version for some time until it finally deprecates or the demand for b2 you know decreases over time but yeah yeah i'm in a similar sort of story as of two weeks ago view three became the quote-unquote new default and because of that i mean it means that library authors are and they're encouraged to make the default version when you install the package be the three version now because of that i've taken the approach that similar to what joff is referring to or swerve was mostly the version that you install it would require a peer dependency of the composition api review two and then the beta version was actually the three version so now i'm in the process of flipping that so that once you install it it'll yell at you if you're trying to install it for v2 and then if you want to go down then you would install like a lesser version and then basically those would be minor patches for any backwards port and then eventually just stop supporting it because at some point you have to stop supporting versions and i just don't have enough time have you started migrating any of your projects from view two to v3 like just like initially and if so what has the developer experience been like has have the view core maintainers done anything to make it easier on you if so if you've might started to migrate any projects that's for me i haven't done anything here yeah for me i haven't really done anything yet but with regards to the viewer version in any of my libraries yeah that's a good question so if you were using the vue cli which in my last company we had to migrate to the vcli and it was it was nice because essentially they abstract away a lot of the webpack config that you don't necessarily need to and then you can hook into it as you need so for view three a lot of the encouragement is to move to veet which is the bundler that is also maintained by avenue and so hooking into that i think that probably is your biggest issue or at least it's and the the other big point is just that the library and the ecosystem has to catch up so if you're using like built-in components that are maintained with in tandem the router or view x which is now being migrated to pina then i think you're pretty good but my my experience is that you end up relying on libraries that aren't as popular and that sort of you need to plan it in advance to make sure that those libraries like have alternates that you can switch to because if they're not going to migrate to view three then you have but one of the big changes from vue two to view three and one of the things that we've talked around but maybe we should talk about is just the composition api and it's just such a big change it almost feels a bit like react hooks in so much that it allows you to reuse logic between components you can of course create composable and use them throughout your components what are your thoughts on this new api is it all good are there any things to watch out for and we can start with you darren since it sounds like you've been using it even before even before view three was the new standard yeah i was definitely very excited when hooks was released to react and i was i think evan yu had a prototype within a week of the release of hooks and he was also on board with just the idea and then the composition api came out so i just saw like all of the pain that i experienced in react for a lot of composition of state this was solved with hooks now and when you say solved it becomes it changes the way that you develop in a lot of ways you're thinking in terms of effects and you're thinking in terms of reactivity across components and not just inside of components but inside of these composables like you say so you you create these primitives or these composables actually that's a distinction view calls them composables and react calls and hooks they're essentially the same thing but at the under the hood you're looking at the reactivity models are different so with react you just have a lot of like corollaries like use effect or watch use effect inside of a view so these different primitives can change the way that you think about programming and yeah it becomes it can become a learning experience but i think for the most part it makes it easier i agree with the dar in there so like with my experience in in with my playing with a composition api with just a few testing i just i got i already got the feeling that it's always to be going to be better than the options api and i i i would agree with darren with when he said that it will force you to think differently in a way that how you approach the problem when creating your components so that but i have here some notable pros and cons for my experiences in using composition api so yeah overall it it will boost the reusability of your of the logic so everything's kept in the one in one place it's easier to read and especially in a larger project so what i've been maintaining definitely migrating to pop composition api would be a really uh great help for us and uh but there's just one thing i i don't want to be picky but the way they use the that value in the reps of variables so sometimes it gets a little bit confusing and when you're using it in the in the setup method so like when you're going to mutate the value of that specific variable you're going to have to access the that value field but if you're going to just use it in in say a watch a watcher you don't have to do that so for me there's it's just a little bit confusing at first maybe especially for the beginners but yeah no big deal and also the way they like on the setup method the way that the way they allow you to export everything in just one object without without the distinction for which switch so everything's bundled together in one object so the data the properties and the method so it's for me it's just a little bit confusing as well but overall the composition apis is way better than the options api yeah i agree with you jeff it definitely is can be confusing and also like the reactivity of it you have to be mindful of what is reactive and what isn't so there are like eslant rules that help you oh you're trying to destructure this function it's going to lose reactivity for instance like the setup script itself like receives props and callbacks to root context and whatnot but if you try and destructure those immediately like you immediately lose reactivity of those things and so there's some linting around it but it still gets you like i would say a good portion of the issues that i get in my open source projects for i guess it's just notably but because of swirl because swerve is a composition hook or a composable i get these issues where people are either destructuring or they are they don't quite understand uh reactivity enough to where i'm just educating them by linking them back to the docs and that's not it's not because they're dumb it's just because it's there are some gotchas with it and once you understand them you can work around them and use them to your advantage but it definitely gets you when you're first doing it yeah i also remembered having the same problem in view so like the reactivity is it has a really big caveat when you're actually a beginner so especially when you're interacting with arrays and then the objects sometimes spreading things will list their activities i think it's a real problem to the point that they actually created uh like a section of about it and their documentation so i think it's just a similar problem from you one of the things that you both brought up was that part of the appeal of vue is that it's really easy to use do you feel and it sounds like the composition apis makes things way more flexible it's it makes things way more flexible but i'm wondering do you think that the composition api makes view less beginner friendly at least view three less beginner friendly than view two because it's not as opinionated about how you structure how you structure your component and like outlining what's reactive and what's not there's not a section where it's your data goes here compute it goes here et cetera i think it's it will going to be a problem i think for me at least because some of my juniors are more comfortable with with the structured a more structured way of doing things so in the options api you literally everything is is there you you just have to read the documentation then and then you will and then you will know where the data goes to the watcher go methods and everything the not a bit more flexible but way more flexible do you think that something like the composition api something that feels like react hooks is essentially inevitable for any framework at this point it just seems like such a powerful concept and tool do you think that like we were going to have something like this in view 3 and that in general frameworks are going to have something that's similar is it inevitable hard to predict the future so for instance i don't know if every like what's felt like there's no there's no component tree to have to walk and there's no there's no virtual dom so because of that there's the frameworks like as they exist like they don't have to build upon the old necessarily and so composables are like a way to hook into the reactivity of the library but it's it's not necessary i don't know if every component it feels right for view and react but i'm not sure it feels right for every back in language or a lot of a lot of developers still like maybe thinking about like event based state so being able to instead of reacting to like changes on setters and getters via proxies maybe like you're reacting to an event bus that is independent of whatever language you're in yeah some sort of road is open all right josh you're saying something i interrupted you right so yeah i agree with darren there so yeah basically it's hard to tell the future but given the pattern from other frameworks i think it's not guaranteed that this technique in the technology will be it be present in other frameworks because as for ref and and vjs so we thought that previously we thought that the the best thing was a virtual dom and then suddenly it came up with something yeah it's not predicting so eventually when you're building like a bigger application you run into having to figure out like how you're going to manage all your state and there's historically there's been ux but there has recently been things popping up like pina i think i saw another one on twitter i forget the name of it but some guy created another option do y'all have an opinion on how you manage like state and which state store you use if you use any you have a favorite yeah i've been i've been using vuex from the start and i haven't tried any alternative yet but i only use uh store when i absolutely needed them but for most of my applications i i i just use the local state of the component and then yeah for me view x is enough for what permanent for what i need at least yeah we use ux for options api and then i was looking to migrate my last company to pina and then i was excited to see that it's supplanting view x and this and the like sort of approved index of libraries that vue is supporting so it's becoming the new ux essentially and because of that i think type like because typescript is king like being able to have this typescript tool chain as it relates to state and your components and your templates it's like the golden path where you're able to like change something on the back end and it trickles down across your entire typing system and that was something that we were really hoping to do but volar which is now becoming vue tsc which is the command line utility for the typescript compiler inside of view components so because that didn't exist when i was doing it so pina was nice because it was like okay i might not be able to type check but i can at least hook into the typescript compiler to see the types of my events and see the typings of my store and so if i'm hooking into a mutation or some some event in my my store i can actually see that type and detect problems before they happen speaking of typing one of the differences between view two and view three is just typescript support um in general and so much that it's more of a first class citizen and like a top of my consideration do you plan to use typescript in your newer projects are you like looking forward to it do you plan to go back to your old projects and add typing if you haven't types everywhere that's my opinion i would use typescript everywhere all the time that would be my opinion i'm not really a big fan of typescript at least up until now that i i've been handing projects big projects without typescript it's a headache but yeah i've been actually i've been planning to to to dive into typescript especially went as chart said it became like up so i think i will be forced to you know learn typescript and implement it in uh view stripe view version 3. i think it's a necessity at this point actually i had a question for jeff do you like what's your contributor stuff look like is this a good place to ask people to contribute i have a passion contributor those the ones that are like contributing to the documentation and then i also have contributors that are like fixing some small bugs and some hypographic errors but mostly i do the the most of the works for for my library and i recently charts helped me with implementing one over the element feature in user but yeah most of my contributors are like i would say i would categorize them as like just casual contributors so just for the chat i i need to know because this is almost a bit of a a thing so who's who's team typescript who's just like in the chat if you would ever start a project without typescript please let me know because it seems like at this point pretty much everyone if they're starting a project and typescript support it they're going to start with typescript i myself haven't haven't really dug into it i'm like dropped there but just curious josh i actually want to dive into why you why you're not necessarily a fan of typescript but yeah i guess the words that i use is is wrong i'm not really not a fan but i just don't have enough use cases for me that i usually do things on demand like so if there's no need for something to be done with a specific tool or technology i don't do it because most of my time i'm doing my i'm doing like company projects and then for my free time which is is very little that's the only time that i you know i get to do what i want for my project so for instance in viewstripe so i just decided to do it the way i already know there's no really this is a decision point where i decided that oh no i don't want to use a type script so yes that i didn't really had the luxury of time to to study typescript and then implement it yeah basically just for that reason awesome we are we're nearing we're nearing our time here so one quick we got we have more time of course but let's say evan used to listening the core team's listening what are some what are some areas that you feel the view ecosystem kind of lags behind react angular or like just in general and we can even throw uh svelton there as well first thank you evan if you are listening i am a big fan for sure i've just been super impressed with react's first class with typescript not to be too much of a fanboy but it's just typescript is so nice for putting that into your front end and being able to like flow and have confidence when you make changes especially because you we move so much of our interactivity and logic into the front end i just i i would just say keep investing in typescript support and making sure that it continues to be supported and i'm just like yeah really thankful for all of the initiatives that have gone into supporting it yeah same with me yeah so basically to be honest i'm really satisfied with how things are going right now so i can't really there's to be honest there's no complaint or anything like that from my end but yeah the pacing of the developments is really uh good as well yeah everything's good so no no complaints no wishes that's some high praise so what are some of your favorite view libraries just as like developers of open source projects yourself are there any that you would like to call out for being particularly awesome yeah i was a big ex-state fan at my last company i've contributed a little bit to the composable 4x8 and i think it's a really great library to use and can be used either at this at the global level and like pervading your entire app or it can just be used in a component if you just want to like maintain something like form state and other than that really i have really like loved pina so i would give a plus one opinion as well right so for me i would definitely pick quasar so it's not necessarily like a library or anything but it's it's more of a framework but for so many years i've been trying to develop mobile applications using view and then nothing really suited my tastes but from my experience quasar really is the is the best uh out there i love grazer also beautify so it helped me like it saved us a bunch of time you know developing our ui and uh it's you know basically the just the convenience of having those libraries and frameworks yes awesome and mikey b is shouting out view use which i think i've heard of i'm like looking at its github page and one of its gold sponsors is ebbing you so that's a pretty that's pretty strong endorsement there recently it's great yeah i used it for this like a little app that i built for a cloudflare hackathon so i just linked to the source code but essentially it gives you a bunch of different utils to play with like interactivity one of the the benefits to it is that if you want to play with like animation or any sort of like browser api if you use hooks hooks into those and can like you can pick and choose different pieces like animation or you want to check when the network dropped your users don't have wi-fi anymore or i'm different it's huge so if you go to the docs you'll just see like all the different different things use media queries a popular one where you're detecting that the window sizing is changing and yeah that sounds really nifty so we're drawing near our time it's pretty much we're pretty much at the hour but before we sign off now's the time to do some shout outs so josh is there anything you'd like to share with the audience or talk about right yeah awesome so yeah basically just want to plug a view stripe so i i really need contributors guys so if you if you if you really want to learn videos and also if you have any questions about ggs or anything that you need help with just you can find me on twitter and you can ask me anything yeah darren is there anything you'd like to share with us apart from the stuff we talked about i don't have anything super explicit but randomly i played an amazing video game recently called it takes two and i played it with my nine-year-old and we beat it together and just unprecedented playing experience it's amazing it's got a great story it's funny a lot of fun things so i would plug it takes you awesome i'm gonna have to try i'm about to try that one out i've been looking for a good co-op game and mikey is mikey b like is saying that he would love to contribute to view stripe joff what would be the best way for people to get involved right so first of all they can start with the issues in the issues page so basically if i have time i give i reply to the issues and interact with them there so basically that's that's the only channel that i have right now but twitter is also available awesome you got you have a contributor over here jeff i'm totally gonna come contribute right thanks oh that's great that that's what we like to hear all right joff darren thank you so much for being our guest audience thank you for thank you so much for the awesome questions and just interactivity it sounds like typescript is the way to go by a pretty large margin so again thank you so much for the awesome questions and a huge shout out to my colleagues especially paul in the chat helping out for their help as well as always let us know if you have any feedback we'll see you in this the next stripe dev live next month thank you all so much have a great rest of your day

subscriptions for recurring payments and share that link with your customers you can share it as many times as you like on social media in emails or any other channel while anyone can create a payment link with no code via the stripe dashboard today we are excited to introduce the payment links api so you can create those links programmatically if you're interested on seeing how to do that with no code check out the video linked in the description [Music] so imagine you're selling books online right now you'd go to the stripe dashboard create a payment link and then share that link on social media after your inventory is exhausted you deactivate the payment link to avoid anyone making further purchases before we create a payment link we need to ensure that our product catalog is set up on stripe for this demo we'll create a new product and a price each time we create a payment link the price will be specified as having inclusive tax behavior that means that when we instruct the payment links api to calculate tax which we'll see in a few moments the tax amount will be inclusive to the total price if you'd like to learn more about getting started with stripe tax you can also see a link for that in the description now we'll create a basic payment link the start will only pass the required line items field it accepts a price in the quantity in addition to releasing the payment links api we're also excited to announce multi-line item support that means that you can create a payment link that will show your customers several products to check out let's follow the link and see the payments page we can improve the payment experience and allow the customer to buy several books at once by enabling adjustable quantities for the line item we can even enable shipping and billing addresses phone number collection promo code support and more all through the single api called the creative payment link as mentioned earlier we can easily add support for automatically calculating collecting taxes let's change the billing address to germany to show that taxes calculated on book sales there and complete the checkout at the end of the payment flow notice that the customer is thanked and that's currently the end of the road for them if we want though we can customize this message or have the customer redirected to a url of our choosing now you see we're redirected to example.com after successfully paying next consider the case where we want to discontinue a product or stop selling books as our inventory is exhausted we can update the payment link and set its active flag to false users who visit that link will be notified that it's no longer active now you can use payment links to kickstart your business or as a compliment to your existing operations you

the next yes framework and one of the quick guide on how to get started with nextgs and payments this is the video for you in this episode we'll go for the basics by showing you how to install an xgs starter app add the striped libraries required initialize stripe gs set up your endpoints and set up a webhook handler if you already have a nexjs app set up and are comfortable setting up new routes and just looking to set up your stripe integration feel free to check out our other videos on this channel where i'll show you how to do exactly that first a quick primer on next.js nexgs is a full stack framework built on node and react focusing on server-side rendering and generating static websites version 12 which was released in october 2021 brought many new exciting features like middleware and a brand new rust compiler to make it even faster than before it's opinionated but don't let that discourage you as it allows you to build websites at breakneck speeds let's jump in and start by installing the next js starter app open up your terminal in this case i'm just using the terminal inside vs code let's run the following command mpx create next app and we'll call it payments next demo now this is using npm's package runner to create a new next.js app without having to first install the create next app package now while this is running a quick note that i'm using node version 16.10.0 if you find you have any problems at any point with the running this demo it's likely going to be your node version all right that's finished now we're going to run first we're going to cd into the holder itself and we're going to run npm run dev we're going to start our server okay that's running let's jump over to chrome look at localhost and there we have it there is next.js running directly in our local environment super easy but this is just the standard next.js sample app so let's explore a little bit more what that looks like i'm going to open up this directory here and here the three folders that we really are interested in is pages public and styles going reverse order styles is the css that we would use in our project public is a lot of static files like our favicon and just a random images and then page is the really important one this is where we find all the content for our site we have an index.js which is that that index screen you just saw which has our react in our html we have an app.js which is our entry point we will mostly leave that alone then we have an api folder which shows a couple well i've chosen example api root so this is just looking here at hello.js this uh just sends a status 200 and some json with the name john doe so let's see how that works if we go back to our browser and do a forward slash api hello and we see there it's returning that json we saw earlier so now let's move on and let's start by installing some of the start dependencies let's stop our server and let's run npm install we're going to install stripe strike gs which is the stripe gs front end we're going to install stripe react stripe js which is our react bindings and we're going to install just right that's node stripe which is our node stripe sdk so let's wait for that to finish all right now in index.js let's import those libraries that we just installed first let us import load stripe from stripe stripe.js and we'll import elements from stripe react.js like so before we go any further with our front end though we're going to need our publisher key and we're going to need our secret key as well eventually so let's look at creating an environmental variable file what's nice about next.js is that if you have an environmental file it'll automatically pick it up let's create a new file in our directory we'll call it env and inside here we're going to put our stripe secret and a publishable key i'm just going to paste this in here but you can get these keys from your dashboard so we have stripe secret key let's try publishable key so now this these dot n files now in our root directory this will be automatically picked up by next yes within your app now we want this to be on our front end therefore we want to create a get route to make sure that our front end can easily request our server for these keys to start in our api folder we're going to create a new file we're going to call it keys.js in here we're going to do export default function handler that's going to have a request and a response we're going to check to see if the request method is a get request and if it is then we're going to do res return status 200 and we're going to return some json as well which is publishable key is process dot n dot stripe publishable key if this is not a get request i'm going to make sure people know that by doing res dot status 405 which means wrong methods and we'll end this with a method not allowed message okay let's give this a test let's start our server and once that is up and running let's go to our browser and we'll go to localhost 3000 api and keys hit enter and yep there we have it there's a publishable key so now we have a get endpoint which returns our publishable key excellent let's go back to index.js and now let's use some of these libraries that we imported so what we're going to do here to make sure that our stripe library runs at the very first thing we do is use a hook from react we're going to use the use effect hook use effect means that it will run immediately as the component begins to render so within our home function here we're going to say use effect and then immediately invoke function expression and we're going to immediately fetch our api keys so we'll say fetch keys and we're going to pass in some options like friction where we are using the get method very important and we'll pass in some headers as well to make sure that we are using oops content type equals application json and after that has fetched we're going to then make sure that it is converted to json and then finally we have some data and for now all we're going to do is console.log that data to make sure that it works so let's save this go back to chrome let's remove these queries at the end here open up our dev tools and we see here already that it logged our publishable key cool so that worked so now that we have that data what are we going to do with it well we're going to use another hook from react this one is called use state which is going to update our state and re-render our component when required so to begin up here we're going to say const publishable key and set publishable key equals use states and this argument this function takes a default and we're just going to default it to an empty string then in here rather than logging things we're going to run that setpublishablekey function with data. publishable key then finally before we test this out let's make sure that if publishable key doesn't exist we return a string that says loading class part is pretty important because while use effect is running asynchronously we want to make sure that we have a publishable key before we do anything with it so if our publisher is not ready yet we want to delay loading our component this will ensure that happens okay so earlier we have this load stripe method now we're actually going to use it because we have a publishable key ready to do that we're going to initialize stripe.js by running const stripe equals load stripe and the publishable key like so and we're going to save this and let's see if this has worked so what load stripe is going to do is it's going to inject stripe gs into our header and start loading the library this actually returns a promise so let's see if that worked so already if i tab back in here i see that i some warnings from stripe just telling me that i need to run it over https and live mode this is totally fine it's just a warning when you deploy this into a live environment using https that'll go away so if i look into our elements and i open up the head and here i see we have our javascript drive.js being loaded correctly automatically injected into the head very cool all right so now our front end has strap just loaded we have our elements we're not going to be using this just yet but that's okay we'll use that in a future video next up we're going to look at creating a post endpoint and a webhook handler so weblogs are useful as it's how stripe informs you about an action that happened on your account for instance a successful payment or a new customer is created so we have many videos or web hooks on this channel so i suggest you give those a watch but here's a quick primer on how to get set up with next gs first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a new webhook endpoint which is going to be a part of an api endpoint so not unlike how we created our keys endpoint earlier we're going to create a new one here we're going to call it webhooks.js and in here again export default function webhook handler with a request under response and we're going to say if the method was a post this time around then we're just going to log it out it's going to log wrap that body all right now how do we test this well we could just hit this endpoint ourselves obviously by writing a fetch function but instead we're going to be using the stripe vs code extension if you haven't got this installed i highly recommend it to install it you can just go to your extensions tab here type in stripe and the very top result right here once you've installed it you get this fun little stripe logo over here which i'm going to click on right now and to get things running first what we want to do is we want to forward events to our local machine so we click on that we determine where we're going to be sent this is already set at the correct place make sure it's local hosts three thousand slash api slash webhooks and hit enter and hit enter again to confirm and what's this gonna do you see that uses the striped cli in our terminal to set up this endpoint all right that's done you might notice the webhook signing secret over here we'll be needing that later for now we can just leave that now we're going to trigger a new default event let's click here and we're just going to do payment intent that's exceeded which is a successful payment hit enter here we see that the stripe cli has sent an event we'll go back to our terminal and here we see from our server the that got logged to this event we have a couple actually we've got payment intent created and we got a payment and succeeded and a charge succeeded all right so all that's come in however we have one problem with this this seems to be working nicely however we have a bit of a security hole here so we don't know where this request came from anyone could potentially hit this endpoint and trick your integration into doing something that you perhaps don't want it to so we need to ensure that these workbooks are actually coming from stripe now luckily there is a great way to do that it's called signature signing with your web hooks so we're going to implement that we're going to start by grabbing the signing secret that we saw in our terminal over here and we're going to put that into our environmental variables i'm going to say stripe webhook signing oops signing secret equals this i'm going to save that and within our web hooks here we're going to change this so that we now can be using that signing secret to cryptographically verify that these web hooks came from stripe and to start what we're going to do is import some new libraries we're going to start with the stripe library this is stripe sd node sdk and we're going to want a new library also from the varicell guys so we're just going to go to our terminal over here we're going to quit our server i'm going to do npm install micro now while that's running micro is just a small light utility library also built by versailles the guys who made next js and this has a bunch of helper methods for your server which we're going to use and the one thing we're particularly interested in is the buffer function from micro okay next up one thing that nexges tries to do to be as helpful as possible because nextgs is running express under the hood is parse every single response that comes through our server to be json parsed now normally this is very useful however in this case we want the raw request body from stripe to be able to verify the signature so we first are going to have to tell nexjs to stop using a body parasite i'm going to do that by export const config which is an object which has another object in it called api and we're going to say body parser false now what's nice about nextgs is that this little config file is specific to this api root which means that turning off the body parser is only going to affect this route and not any of your other routes very cool now in our web camera we're going to change this to be an async function we're going to get rid of this console.log and we are going to first initialize our stripe library like so i'm going to take process dot n dot stripe secret key because we need a secret key on our back end all right within our if statement we need to get the buffer payload which is we're going to use buffer quest that's going to grab us the raw payload for this particular web hook event we need the signing signature which is going to be rec headers stripe signature if this does come from stripe this will exist and we're going to need our web webhook secret which as we put earlier is in process dot n dot i've forgotten the exact what i've put earlier so we're just going to copy paste this which is probably better there we go and we're going to create define an event now we're going to do a little try catch here because this sometimes can go wrong and we want to be able to log into sort of errors that come in so first we're going to do in our try catch if signature doesn't exist as in this didn't come from stripe or if we don't have a webhook signing secret then we just want to return then we're going to define our event as stripe.webhooks.construct event i'm going to add in the payload the signature and the workbook secret if there's an error something went wrong here we are going to first log it for our purpose we're going to say webhook error and we're just going to say error.message to tell us exactly what went wrong then we will return res dot status we'll say it's a 400 and we're going to send the exact same thing so we'll send webhook error and the error message itself it's very important to return an error status here to the stripe api if something went wrong because that in that tells stripe that something is incorrect which means that stripe will try your web hook event again later and then finally after that we are going to just log out the event itself just so we can see that it worked and afterwards we will make sure that we return by sending a 200 response and we'll send now it's very very important to actually send this 200 response once your payload has been successfully received by your input reason being if stripe gets anything but a 200 response back it'll just assume that the webhook event failed and will try to reset resend at a later point once there are enough failures over a period of time stripe will automatically disable your webhook endpoint so please do make sure to return this 200 status code in your code okay let's give that a go so we're going to run our server stripes should already be set up and listening to the correct endpoint so let's trigger under default lens we'll do payment intent succeeded again right that run let's go over here and we see we have our events being logged out as we expect and what's cool about this now is that this is now verified to be coming from stripe and there's no potential for a man-in-the-middle attack on our server so we can be fairly confident in fact very confident that this came from stripe tarika in this episode we learned how to create an xjs app how to import the required stripe libraries how to create roots with next.js and how to set up a web hook endpoint so that does it for this episode if you enjoyed what you saw please consider hitting like and subscribe or check out any other videos on

is one of the most powerful tools you can use when building and testing your stripe integration if you'd like to watch a deep dive video on the stripes cli you can find a link in the description let's take a moment though to recap on some of the great features you can use to drive your development process you can via the command line use the stripe cli to list retrieve create and update many different types of resources like payment intents charges customers and checkout sessions to name a few you can also use the cli to tell the logs in your account so that you can see in real time the calls that your system is making and you can even create your own sophisticated fixtures and now the stripe cli is available for testing directly in the stripe docs known as the stripe shell since stripe shell runs in the browser there are a couple of features that are only available in the command line interface but being able to trigger events listen to events in your account and query and manipulate resources from anywhere in the stripe docs is immensely powerful so let's take a look [Music] the first thing to check is that you're signed into your stripe account you can see this when you navigate to the stripe docs and check the top right corner if you're signed in you'll see the name of your stripe account there once you've made sure that you're signed in there's two ways to invoke the stripe shell firstly you can navigate to the stripe cli docs under development tools there you'll see a button labeled try it online if you click the button the shell will appear if you're logged in you can invoke the shell from anywhere inside the docs using the keyboard shortcut control and backtick for example if i happen to be on the docs homepage and i'd like to access the shell i can simply hit control back tick to open it let's start experimenting one of the main features of the shell is that it allows you to learn experiment and manage resources in your account so let's start with listing payment intents on our account you'll notice that the shell will auto-complete as you type you can hit tab to iterate through the options listed below and hit enter to select the currently highlighted option and you can also click on the autocomplete options to add it to your command this is a brand new account so as expected we don't have any payment intents so let's use the shell to create one the required fields are listed at the top so let's provide an amount and a currency list again and see what we get if we expand the first and only element in the data array we can see our new payment intent what if we made a mistake though and are charging the customer too much we need to update it so let's go and do that we'll click on the clipboard icon next to the payment intent id then let's update the payment attempt to charge only 10 euros before we do that though since the update command will take a payment intent id let's check the format of that command by using the help argument for update it seems like we passed the payment intent id and then the parameters so let's go ahead and update the amount we can already see in the response the amount of the payment intent has been updated to 10 euros let's verify that in the dashboard there we have it we've created and updated a payment intent with just a few keystrokes right in the browser let's jump into the docs for interacting with the api notice in the code snippets there's commands for the stripe cli i can copy that code snippet and run it directly here in the shell as i'm reading through the dock or if you see the green play button next to a stripe cli command you can simply click it and it will automatically run that command in the shell so now you're already equipped to start to experiment and manage apr resources using the stripe shell let's experiment with events in our system we'll start by splitting the shell into two panes in the first pane let's call stripe listen to listener events in our account and in the second let's create a payment intent cool we can see that the shell is listening for the exact event that we expect when creating a payment intent you might know this from the stripes cli but it's also possible to trigger specific events too let's trigger the payment intent succeeded event again you can see that autocomplete is immensely helpful here you might notice that we receive multiple events in our pane that's listening that's because the payment intent succeeding also creates a charge object so we see all of the related events while the browser shell cannot forward events to your local development server it's still possible to use other tunneling software like ngrok to tunnel events from your stripe account to your local dev machine and trigger those events from the shell in my case i've set up a tunnel and i'm using that to send webhook events from my stripe account to my local dev machine this is so useful when building and testing a web hook endpoint on your local machine i'm running a super simple sinatra app locally which will echo when certain event types are posted at the endpoint so let's go ahead and trigger a payment intent succeeded event in the shell nice and there you have it now you can trigger events from the shell and develop your webhook endpoint code locally and react and fulfill orders if you installed the native stripe cli you would be able to start an event listener on the command line and forward those events to your local dev machine all in one command without having to configure a webhook endpoint in the dashboard so we do highly recommend installing that for your development tool chain finally if you're a vs code user you can install the stripe vs code extension and listen for events trigger events tell your logs and much more all integrated right into vs code this extension is underpinned by the stripe cli the stripe cli is an essential tool that you can use to develop and test your stripe integration it's available as a standalone command line tool integrated as an extension with vs code and now it's available right inside the browser with stripe shell we hope you enjoyed this short introduction to striped shell if you have any questions comments or feedback please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at stripe dev on twitter my handle is mat link underscore dev where you can join in the conversation on our discord server thanks so much for joining us and see you next time\", metadata={'source': '92c4VmsFVpU', 'title': 'Getting started with the Stripe Shell',

Document(page_content=\"payment lease lets you accept one-time payments and recurrence subscriptions with just a few clicks and now payment links are integrated on zapier to talk more about how to use payment links to share payment pages anywhere you'd like whether it's social media text or email i am joined by cass a software engineer on the zapier team thanks for joining cass thanks charles all right cass so what is zapier zapier lets you automate tasks with no code it connects together over four thousand apps like facebook slack google sheets uh to help you handle lead management build marketing automation workflows create reconciliation flows and more some of the popular ways to use zapier include getting notified about a new purchase keeping track of data by logging into a spreadsheet for future tasks like fulfillment or an email newsletter we work with businesses of all sizes from solopreneurs standing up their first product to whole companies building internal tools for the entire team that's super cool so how do you actually build an automation with zapier what are the pieces and parts and steps and such it's pretty simple to automate tasks on zapier we call it building zaps you're essentially telling apps to follow a simple command when this happens do this every zap has a trigger and one or more actions a trigger is an event that starts as app and an action is then what your zap does for example as a simple overview we'll cover it in more depth soon new payment links can be automatically created when a row is added in air table the trigger is the new air table row and the action is a new payment link oh that's super cool so since we know what we can do with payment links and zapier and it sounds like there are tons and tons of possibilities um let's actually try it out so i have my air table here which for those who haven't used air table it's a bit between a database and a spreadsheet and this is where i'm managing a product catalog of limited edition t-shirts so here i have all of my product information my product name an image a description a price and a last updated tag as well as a column of where a payment link would go and so our goal is going to be to create a zapier integration that automatically adds a payment link whenever we add a row to this product catalog first step we're going to just hop on over to zapier and we have no zaps yet so i'm going to create a zap and uh trigger like you said uh trigger's the first part of my zap so i guess i would start with uh air table and with this air table i would like to trigger it every time a new record is created okay so i'm going to grab my base and limited edition t-shirts my product catalog and my limited view now when i test this trigger it's pulling my actual product information this is coming directly from air table let's see here and if i go to my record so i'm just going to pick this one this represents the first row i think so i'll click continue and then for my next step i'm going to click stripe beta at the time of this video if you want to do stuff with payment links you should go to stripe beta right yes yes um this is just how we're launching the new the new app with the new features okay super cool and like you said i can create a payment link a price a product and deactivate a payment link now from the stripe side i know that in order to create a payment link you need a price and in order to create a price you need a product and in the old days you had to create all of these things in a dashboard so it's pretty neat that you can do it with zapier but we'll start by creating a product i'm going to select my stripe account which i've already authenticated and here i just need to add in my information so only the name is required and i can dynamically add the name by picking stuff from this first step of new record so i have my name i can also add in the description an image and this can be a url i believe so we'll grab the image url and the tax code so we're going to skip that for now so now i have a product and if i go ahead and click test and continue this should create a live mode version of this product and actually send it to stripe so here's a product id and if i go to stripe products i have no products now but if i refresh a product should be created and here it is this is the product that aligns with the row that i just made inside uh this row here in my limited edition t-shirt space so that's working pretty well i have a product but i have no prices so i can't sell it i just go back now i need to create my price and if i create a price here this can use the information that i made that i used when i created my product so to set up this action the first thing i'm going to need is the product that i just created so we can find that here and specifically we're going to want the id now the rest of the information is actually going to come from our base so inside of our brace we had a price and the price is currently in cents and you have to actually send it in cents and caspian a software engineer will probably tell you why it's probably pretty dangerous to do currencies with uh floats and decibels and such and then for our currency we'll set that to usd uh we could do this from our base but in some cases you can actually safely hard code stuff in an airtable base like that's totally legit right cass yeah i want to hardcore my currency uh for recurring or one time this is not a t-shirt subscription so we're going to do one time hit continue so this is going to create a price and if we click test this should create a price which means that if we go to products and we refresh we should now have a price all right so we're selling our t-shirt for a hundred dollars it's an expensive t-shirt kanye west probably made that t-shirt that's why it's so expensive okay so now we're going to create our payment link and we're going to use the price that we just created here and let's see here so here's our price our price and we can set our quantity or we can do like adjustable quantities but there's these are limited editions so you can only buy one we can set collect tax automatically to true but it's exclusive anyway um we can choose to allow promotion codes but we haven't set anything up and also it wouldn't really make sense to have uh promotion codes for a limited edition t-shirt now in terms of collecting addresses and shipping addresses that is important for fulfillment so we'll select that and uh for allowed countries we're just gonna do the united states we can actually do multiple options here as long as it's comma delimited it seems and then the phone number we can select true or false but for our use case we don't actually need it and then finally when it comes to payment links you have the opportunity to either show a confirmation page that's hosted on the stripe payment page or redirect back to your site in my case i don't have a website so i'm just going to show a confirmation page and i can put in a nice semi-dynamic message like thank you for purchasing and then we can add in the name of the product so product name this product name and right now it's the original henley shirt number one but if this zap were to run on a different product i think it would show a different name this is all dynamic right this name is dynamic i can actually kind of have something like a template like this exactly yeah that's all dynamic so this is like showing you to give you confidence of what the data would look like when the zap ran but when the zap actually runs it's all totally dynamic whatever info is in the air table will be what comes through to all these stripe steps oh that's awesome okay so let's give this a shot here let's create this payment link and we're gonna click test and continue and this should create a payment link inside of stripe and it has i can actually we can actually see the link here so this is a live mode payment link here so you can see we have our product page which i've made zapier orange on one side you can do those type of custom customizations in the stripe dashboard we have all the product information from our zap including the product name the image the description the price so the last thing we have to do is actually put our payment link in our base so we'll do air table i'm pretty sure update record okay we'll pick our air table and if i wanted to actually like backfill this flow um is there an option to do that like i know i can kind of trigger it now but if i needed to backfill it is that actually possible with a zap what do you mean by backfill well right now i have two rows so i have this row and i have that row and right now i'm i'm using zapier to test this row um row number one i'm thinking that like for this action i'm gonna i need to update the payment link so if i go to payment link and i update it i can add in my actual payment link url if i can find it let's see oh i have to pick my record my original airtable record should show somewhere in here uh yeah that's the right id so what i meant by backfill is right now i think that if i hit test and continue this record was sent to airtable so this last one should update the record so that it updates the row from step one to have the payment link so i'm going to hop in over here and it does right and that's great so by backfill what i meant was that is there a way for me to automatically get this one in all of the existing rows to have payment links too because i've already added it in my payment link my zap years app is only running every time i add a new record but i have this old record and i want to run it too right that's what i meant by yeah okay uh yeah once you so once you turn a zap on it will dynamically get all the data so really you want to sort of turn this up on before you start having these flows so as soon as you know you're selling limited edition t-shirts you'd want to create that zap so it just captures all the information in real time as the products are added um we do have a product called transfer uh that's fairly new that was released recently from zapier and that one has sort of more backfill compatibility that you're talking about to be able to go through and update historical data as opposed to um zapier in in throughout history has only really done um real-time data from the time of when you turn the zap on so yes you can check out uh check out transfer if you wanted to try out backfilling backfilling that data essentially it's sort of like a zap but it runs for all previous data that already exists in air table as opposed to the next piece of data and then you can obviously combine that so you can do the historical backfill and then have your zap on to also capture future future products oh awesome i'll have to check out transfers but it is possible so let's let's give it a let's uh let's turn this on like this works i could i could do this let's see i'll just i'll just run it on both just to be safe awesome if i go here let's see oh there it is it works this is great and i can take this app and i can just like extend it however i'd like that the case yeah if you want to go through and add extra things uh you can do that okay one last thing i said that you could share pay link payment link anywhere so i'm going to share it anyway so let's see i'm on twitter so i'm going to just create a tweet and i'm already authenticated here pretty sure so let's go ahead and add an action and let's see if this works our latest t-shirt dropped be sure to buy it here and then let's see i can probably grab my payment link url here get them while they're still there all right cool so maybe not the best copy ever and image url i put in my image url and i can shorten it okay so let's let's like tweet this out all right it's saying that to twitter that it tweeted so let's see oh there it is awesome all right so you can just add this and you can extend it uh very easily by just adding on additional steps payment links is the easiest way to get started creating a hosted payment page on stripe and now that we have zapier as an integration it is easier than ever cass thank you so much for taking the time to show us how to use zapier and payment links and thank you for helping build uh the zapier payment links integration we really appreciate it it's super awesome you're very welcome charles thanks for having me on to do this recording um and thanks to everyone else in the team who also helped build this integration for zapier so that's all for

optimized payments experience is hard. Form formatting, error\\nhandling, payment methods, there are so many things to keep in mind that even large, sophisticated\\nbusinesses make mistakes despite having entire teams devoted to the payments experience. Rather than reinventing the wheel and diverting resources\\naway from other priorities, we've built Checkout, to make it easier for businesses to offer best in class\\npayments experience, while reducing the integration\\nand maintenance effort. Checkout is our flagship integration for both e-commerce and\\nsubscription businesses. It's an optimized hosted payments page that access a natural\\nextension of your website as the domain and branding\\ncan be customized. It combines all the knowhow from our front end, design\\nand analytics teams, and it's a result of\\ncontinuous optimizations across hundreds of thousands of merchants. Conversion features are\\nbuilt in by default, like address auto complete, which it can increase conversion by 0.8% or one click payments\\nusing link with Stripe which lets returning customers\\ncheck out four X faster. Is fully responsive and\\ndesigned to work across devices with out-of-box support for\\nboth Apple Pay and Google Pay. It has powerful plug and play features to capture more revenue such\\nas adjustable quantities, cross sells of products\\nand subscription of sales. And finally it's globally optimized. That means it's localized\\nin over 25 languages and supports over dozens payment methods. Plus it is fully SCA ready and able to handle dynamic tax\\ncalculation with Stripe tax. When you use Checkout, your customers are re-redirected from your website to a\\nprebuilt payments page, which is hosted by Stripe\\nand optimized for conversion. They are then redirected\\nback to your website once they complete a transaction. Checkout drastically\\nsimplifies your integration, with few API costs and less maintenance and more out of the box optimizations. If you want to build your own payment page with full CSS level customization, you can use Stripe elements. Elements extracts some Checkout's most powerful payment features. That means you still got some of the same conversion optimizations like form formatting, access to 20 plus payment methods and stay PCI compliant. But to access more powerful\\nfeatures like promo codes, upsells, tax and subscription, you'll need to spend time\\nto build it yourself. Integrating with elements will require more engineering effort but lets you have more control over the look and feel\\nof your payments page. If you're looking to accept\\npayments without any coding, you can create a payment link\\nfrom your Stripe dashboard. Stripe payment links lets you\\ncreate a Stripe Checkout page in just a few clicks, and share our usable link to sell products or subscriptions. Let's recap what we have learned. To start accepting payments online, Stripe offers three\\npayment user interfaces. Checkout which is a prebuilt\\nhosted payments page that is optimized for conversion, elements, which is with\\nthe free UI building blocks that can be embedded on your site to create a secure payments experience. And payment links, which\\nis a no code solution. You can create a Stripe Checkout\\npage in just a few clicks and share the link with your\\ncustomers via any channel.

two really awesome guests with us today is joffrey sequez um the creator and maintainer of viewstrike and just an awesome developer overall welcome joff please tell us a little bit about yourself hey hello i hope everyone can hear me thanks church for the introduction yeah thanks for inviting me here in stripe live q a my name is joff i'm from manila i'm the creator of viewstripe and i'm currently working as the tech lead and head of front-end development for my cure so it's basically a startup company here in manila and i like open source and i have a bunch of javascript and vue.js projects that you can check out on my github and for my hobbies i do reclaiming and cycling awesome and we all we're also joined by darren who's on the software engineering team here at stripe and also an open source developer also someone who maintains quite a few projects as a maintainer and a creator darren would you introduce yourself as well yeah thanks so yeah i'm darren uh software engineer at stripe so team i'm on we handle authentication for a number of products at stripe but most notably like api keys so as it relates to vue i've been a user review since around like 2017 so i've done some work experience in view but born out of that work experience has been open sourced a few libraries most recent one being swerve so this is a viewport of a react data fetching library swr and yeah i don't do any front end stripe so that's what i'm currently at cool so just to kick things off let's say let's start with you darren can you give us a quick down just like a quick rundown of what is view for those of us that may have joined who are want to learn more about the view ecosystem in view as well sure yeah so vue.js i think if you just went to the website it would market itself as the progressive javascript framework so it's a way to create javascript apps insert interactivity into websites http websites so you're being able to progressively enhance portions of your app that you want to make more interactive with javascript and make it a little easier to do and in terms of yeah i think that's basically it yeah i think that's a great rundown it is very much like the progressive web framework you can add it as just like a script tag download it from a cdn and use it like a bit of a jquery type of situation very lightweight very easy to use so let's here's a question for both of you and let's start with joff how did you get started with vue and what was your first project yeah so basically for me it was actually more of a company directed rather than a personal choice so there was a time when we were thinking of upgrading our web apps which were made in angularjs if you can guys remember that basically we were upgraded upgrading our web apps into a newer framework and so our options back then were angular 2 and then react.js and and of course the relatively new version to pjs and yeah basically we were assigned to to do research on those frameworks and i was the one who was assigned to to do research for bjs and then yeah long story short we did a lot of benchmarking and prototyping you know all those sorts of comparisons for the three frameworks and then yeah finally we we decided to pick vjs and along with the beautify as our main css slash component library and yeah from there i got addicted to view basically yeah my first project was uh it's an internal uh web application for our company and then my first open source project for bjs was yeah it's viewstripe so i've been maintaining viewstrike for like about four years now i think awesome and what about you yeah i was about 2017 it was a job we were at php shop so i think a lot of the success that vue has had has been around like inside of the php ecosystem specifically laravel so we were maintaining a few apps that were didn't have necessarily any tied to any back-end but we did have a php back in they were looking to integrate and we did reach at first for progressive advancement where you're basically just injecting it into a few components that you want more reactive but then as we built more and more onto it this was like for a e-commerce platform like etsy so it's like an etsy type platform where we had like interactive search and different whether you're liking products etc so we were trying to make the app not have too much javascript front loaded like a single page application and we were just progressively enhancing it but we did weigh a bunch of options and vue was like at the time this was like before the composition api even so a lot of the benefits that you brought was the learning curve someone say like how do i get how do i learn react or how do i learn view as the views really just go read the docs the docs were such a powerful learning tool and they still continue to be just i think a north star for a lot of other technical projects and so because of the benefits of the docs and needing the team we were actually a team of mostly backend engineers at the time and we needed to all become full stack and at the time it seemed like front end was overwhelming or there was too many tools or you had to install a thousand dependencies but with vue it just seemed like very elegant a way to dip our toes into reactivity as it relates to like the newer frameworks that were coming out at the time and so we went with vue as a way to expedite and i think for a lot of people when they see view for the first time it says oh this makes sense it's html css and javascript and when you package it into single single file components it just clicks for a lot of people yeah that i feel like that's like a very common narrative like you're oftentimes like a end developer especially with the php laravel ecosystem um really curious to know either what the back story is about that was there like what exactly is it about laravel and vue that leads so many people to use the two together is it do either you all know the back stories of that one yeah actually that's i was also curious about that one so that i have actually the same question for for darren like i haven't really tried uh view with laravel ever because there's really no need for me too but yeah i'm just also curious how the experience yeah historically from what i understand was that view before laravel signed off onto it it was lesser known it was considered a pet project and laravel at the time taylor atwell the creator i think him and a few of their core teams this is uh this is actually a little bit of speculation so i think that they were trying to figure out like what would be the default front end for laravel because it is like a rails type framework that allows you to do the whole mvc flow of your controller so being able to pick a view layer that also has that single that single page application type interactivity being able to pick a framework that makes sense for people coming from this like old style php into laravel and then migrating them into a javascript paradigm it was at one point taylor outwell made the mid view the default like when you installed laravel because of that i think it took off in in that sphere and then it had a ripple effect through two other two other frameworks that's really interesting so that's incredibly interesting one of the things that that like both of you touched on it sounds like you started off with vue because it was like driven by a company at the decision by your company but afterwards you're both open source maintainers of different view projects several view projects so what is it about vue that kept you that captured you so that you decided to use it not only for just work projects but perhaps for like open source projects that might not be related to the things that you're doing at work why do you like view right for me it's basically the learning curve my experiences in in web development started in vanilla javascript and then i discovered jquery and then after that the angular angularjs the first version and yeah when i started to develop things in view it just like uh darren said it somehow just clicks for me and everything is is easier so i guess that's it yeah i have a similar my first job was angular and then my second job was in react and this was like right when they were introducing like some of the babble transforms to be able to do class components and it was definitely coming to view i felt there's definitely this thought behind react that it like clicks for people coming out of like functional paradigms so you're able to compose and you feel like the function the functional aspects of the programming language like javascript is it's like a first-class citizen whereas with vue that's using like proxies and having to observe side effects not in the most functional way so because of that the magic aspects of you i don't think actually like at first they seem like it's too magical oh i update this and then it fires off this whereas when react you know you're always explicitly setting state or running effects so because of that i think like the magic aspects they get in your way in some regards but for the most part they just click for the majority of use cases and then when you want to opt out of them vue has those either like jsx opt-outs to where you're actually explicitly creating jsx fragments or you're having to use some of the primitives with the composition api so in swerve you have to use a few of the i wouldn't say like not paved road methods to because it's like at the library but when you're actually developing applications you're not developing for libraries so you don't you can you have to worry about as much whereas i feel like in some of the other frameworks it's a little more verbose definitely and speaking of swerves so that's one of the larger projects that you maintain question for you both darren and joff like what are the largest view projects that open source view projects that you currently maintain and why did you build them you start where you yeah basically for me it's uh the largest project that i'm maintaining is view stripe and then i also have some collection collection of filters and directives and how i got into how i started viewstrip is also like uh similar with how i started with view so basically in my company we were asked to implement a stripe checkout for one of our products and then yeah from there at first i was i was just like developing a reusable component and then i decided to upload it to github and then suddenly some people are you're asking upgrades for the project and then i i suddenly realized that that i accidentally operated an open source project so i just went with it and upgrade everything so basically if there's a demand for an upgrade or or an addition to to the features yeah i give time for it yeah awesome man what about you there yeah like you mentioned swerve is probably my largest project it's it's a project that's still under the organization at my previous company but i continue to be the sole maintainer for it and it's it's big in the sense that i probably get the most issues for it right now i also maintain a library called view auto suggest which is a component that abstracts away some of the combo box plus like aria controls for if you want to make a auto suggest component or some autocomplete component like accessible i maintain that and that's probably the longest running one that i've maintained so it doesn't have as as many incoming issues i'm currently thinking about migrating into view three at the moment where a swerve already exists for v3 awesome so sean just asked what do you guys think of svelte which is like the i've heard that one popping up a lot so i'm really interested at which i think about that one as well i think it's really awesome so spell is this amazing framework that sort of flips the script with a lot of the things that we thought were possible with javascript and interactivity and it takes it in a way that i think is really appealing because it has that same spirit of view which is let's progressively enhance some components and let's do so in a way that is intuitive and when you read spell you're just like it's a breath of fresh air it's okay i update that and that component updates but then it also i think pushes the boundary for what the other frameworks are needing to come to grips with which is that things like composition api with vue and things like hooks and react they are they can be hard for not just beginning use cases but even medium to advanced use cases and so svel i think has this amazing ecosystem of things and view is actually borrowing from it at first people were opposed to jsx and then was felt they're opposed as they're like what's going on with this compiler this isn't even actually valid javascript like this isn't an actual method when i run it or these tokens these sigils that you have to put in front of your variables to make sure that they're reactive so views borrowing that stuff from them and i think it's it's only benefiting everyone right likewise so yeah yeah yeah likewise so i agree with so basically a funny thing is uh just this morning i was trying and trying out this belt and yeah the framework is awesome and the way they designed the things how they do the things that they are doing basically it's a lot for me it's a bit i'm getting a feeling up it's a bit like a more low level than than compared to view and tour app but definitely overall it's a great framework and i think it will go far one really interesting they think that's all about svelt recently was when you actually write libraries for view and react like a lot of times they're like react autosuggest or view stripe with with felt i was actually running into these vanilla js libraries so they were just like for anyone to implement in whatever app if you're angular what not and i was looking at a couple of recent ones like i'm trying to remember the names it was like a there's a walkthrough for like being able to see different like parts of your app like guide users to different elements and i looked under the hood and it was actually built and felt and then just compiled to javascript so with like vgs and react a lot of times you have these front loaded script tags to say well i'm using react 16 and then anything else knows about that global react but it's felt like because it compiles away you can get smaller bundles and you don't have it's not like i need spell in a script tag before i load this other library and so i thought that was really cool just like seeing it as like an engine for vanilla javascript libraries it sounds like sounds like i need to test out swell it sounds like we all need to test house there's like a lot of good stuff apparently in that framework is there anything so darren you mentioned that vue has actually picked up some things from svel having never used it myself what are some of those things that are spelt like you would say in view or probably i'm imagining it's view through yeah there's these things called reactivity transforms is what the docs refers to them as and the setup script is i think borrowed from seville because essentially when you looked at like a svelte component there's no here's the function here's the export here's the it's just here's the javascript and it just works with the template you don't have to tell the template like what you're sending it and so put up script and view allows you to just say hit the script tag you denote it with the keyword setup and then everything inside of the script tag will be exported for availability in the template then you have these things like refs so refs are a primitive inside of view that allow you to hook into the reactivity for the composition api so because of that composition api ref you have to tell the template or i'm sorry you have to tell the other functions inside of your script tag oh this is a ref so i need to actually call dot value and calling that dot value is a little cumbersome you can add a sigil to your ref instantiation via dollar sign and then view actually at compile time transform it to be something that the interpreter can handle and so you don't everything doesn't need to call dot value it just sort of like works which is as i understand it borrowed from felt i didn't know that was the thing i'm going to be using that a lot i found from like migrating from like view two to view three having to call dot value on things that you declare as reactive sometimes if you're using like an extension like i think like volar will remind you to do it or do it automatically for you but it is definitely like one of those things can occasionally trip people up speaking of the composition api and reps and things of that nature how has view changed since you started using it i would say a lot because someone who's just been using vue js for so many years now so like i i encountered the limitations for the the current options api so many times for a lot of my projects and then and just comparing it to how composition api works it's the comparison between the changes it's like uh huge so basically just from the composition api you can tell that there's really a great a big difference between the yeah this change i was part of a team that was 100 options api and then we introduced the composition beta so the composition api has a view to shim so that you can actually start using it before you migrate to v3 and so actually swerve is an options api only library it doesn't actually work with i'm sorry it's a composition only api library so it doesn't actually work with the options api so because of that you need it has a pure dependency of the composition api shim and then the there's another version or of you three explicitly and so anyway my team that we were migrating from options api to composition api that was a pretty big change for a lot of people it definitely is it's not a few like syntax updates your components change fundamentally luckily you can do it per component you don't have to it's not like a full rewrite of your app and so you can optionally hook into you can even create like wrappers around options and uh components to hook into reactivity if you need to so yeah change for the better in my opinion that's good definitely speaking of you three it sounds like you've already adopted it for some of your projects darren or at the very least like you're using the shim so that you can do the composition api with you too i'm curious are if you have view to libraries are you thinking about adopting uh view three anytime and if so what are those features that you're looking forward to when you migrate from view to the view three and we can start with yuja right yeah so definitely yes i would i would love to migrate my projects into v3 because as far as i know the default for view now is the version three right so i think it's inevitable to to move from view to view three but yeah the plans are to migrate little by little and then uh maybe for view stripe i'm thinking of creating a separately new version for a view for version three of view js and then we'll just have the viewer version exists alongside with the new version for some time until it finally deprecates or the demand for b2 you know decreases over time but yeah yeah i'm in a similar sort of story as of two weeks ago view three became the quote-unquote new default and because of that i mean it means that library authors are and they're encouraged to make the default version when you install the package be the three version now because of that i've taken the approach that similar to what joff is referring to or swerve was mostly the version that you install it would require a peer dependency of the composition api review two and then the beta version was actually the three version so now i'm in the process of flipping that so that once you install it it'll yell at you if you're trying to install it for v2 and then if you want to go down then you would install like a lesser version and then basically those would be minor patches for any backwards port and then eventually just stop supporting it because at some point you have to stop supporting versions and i just don't have enough time have you started migrating any of your projects from view two to v3 like just like initially and if so what has the developer experience been like has have the view core maintainers done anything to make it easier on you if so if you've might started to migrate any projects that's for me i haven't done anything here yeah for me i haven't really done anything yet but with regards to the viewer version in any of my libraries yeah that's a good question so if you were using the vue cli which in my last company we had to migrate to the vcli and it was it was nice because essentially they abstract away a lot of the webpack config that you don't necessarily need to and then you can hook into it as you need so for view three a lot of the encouragement is to move to veet which is the bundler that is also maintained by avenue and so hooking into that i think that probably is your biggest issue or at least it's and the the other big point is just that the library and the ecosystem has to catch up so if you're using like built-in components that are maintained with in tandem the router or view x which is now being migrated to pina then i think you're pretty good but my my experience is that you end up relying on libraries that aren't as popular and that sort of you need to plan it in advance to make sure that those libraries like have alternates that you can switch to because if they're not going to migrate to view three then you have but one of the big changes from vue two to view three and one of the things that we've talked around but maybe we should talk about is just the composition api and it's just such a big change it almost feels a bit like react hooks in so much that it allows you to reuse logic between components you can of course create composable and use them throughout your components what are your thoughts on this new api is it all good are there any things to watch out for and we can start with you darren since it sounds like you've been using it even before even before view three was the new standard yeah i was definitely very excited when hooks was released to react and i was i think evan yu had a prototype within a week of the release of hooks and he was also on board with just the idea and then the composition api came out so i just saw like all of the pain that i experienced in react for a lot of composition of state this was solved with hooks now and when you say solved it becomes it changes the way that you develop in a lot of ways you're thinking in terms of effects and you're thinking in terms of reactivity across components and not just inside of components but inside of these composables like you say so you you create these primitives or these composables actually that's a distinction view calls them composables and react calls and hooks they're essentially the same thing but at the under the hood you're looking at the reactivity models are different so with react you just have a lot of like corollaries like use effect or watch use effect inside of a view so these different primitives can change the way that you think about programming and yeah it becomes it can become a learning experience but i think for the most part it makes it easier i agree with the dar in there so like with my experience in in with my playing with a composition api with just a few testing i just i got i already got the feeling that it's always to be going to be better than the options api and i i i would agree with darren with when he said that it will force you to think differently in a way that how you approach the problem when creating your components so that but i have here some notable pros and cons for my experiences in using composition api so yeah overall it it will boost the reusability of your of the logic so everything's kept in the one in one place it's easier to read and especially in a larger project so what i've been maintaining definitely migrating to pop composition api would be a really uh great help for us and uh but there's just one thing i i don't want to be picky but the way they use the that value in the reps of variables so sometimes it gets a little bit confusing and when you're using it in the in the setup method so like when you're going to mutate the value of that specific variable you're going to have to access the that value field but if you're going to just use it in in say a watch a watcher you don't have to do that so for me there's it's just a little bit confusing at first maybe especially for the beginners but yeah no big deal and also the way they like on the setup method the way that the way they allow you to export everything in just one object without without the distinction for which switch so everything's bundled together in one object so the data the properties and the method so it's for me it's just a little bit confusing as well but overall the composition apis is way better than the options api yeah i agree with you jeff it definitely is can be confusing and also like the reactivity of it you have to be mindful of what is reactive and what isn't so there are like eslant rules that help you oh you're trying to destructure this function it's going to lose reactivity for instance like the setup script itself like receives props and callbacks to root context and whatnot but if you try and destructure those immediately like you immediately lose reactivity of those things and so there's some linting around it but it still gets you like i would say a good portion of the issues that i get in my open source projects for i guess it's just notably but because of swirl because swerve is a composition hook or a composable i get these issues where people are either destructuring or they are they don't quite understand uh reactivity enough to where i'm just educating them by linking them back to the docs and that's not it's not because they're dumb it's just because it's there are some gotchas with it and once you understand them you can work around them and use them to your advantage but it definitely gets you when you're first doing it yeah i also remembered having the same problem in view so like the reactivity is it has a really big caveat when you're actually a beginner so especially when you're interacting with arrays and then the objects sometimes spreading things will list their activities i think it's a real problem to the point that they actually created uh like a section of about it and their documentation so i think it's just a similar problem from you one of the things that you both brought up was that part of the appeal of vue is that it's really easy to use do you feel and it sounds like the composition apis makes things way more flexible it's it makes things way more flexible but i'm wondering do you think that the composition api makes view less beginner friendly at least view three less beginner friendly than view two because it's not as opinionated about how you structure how you structure your component and like outlining what's reactive and what's not there's not a section where it's your data goes here compute it goes here et cetera i think it's it will going to be a problem i think for me at least because some of my juniors are more comfortable with with the structured a more structured way of doing things so in the options api you literally everything is is there you you just have to read the documentation then and then you will and then you will know where the data goes to the watcher go methods and everything the not a bit more flexible but way more flexible do you think that something like the composition api something that feels like react hooks is essentially inevitable for any framework at this point it just seems like such a powerful concept and tool do you think that like we were going to have something like this in view 3 and that in general frameworks are going to have something that's similar is it inevitable hard to predict the future so for instance i don't know if every like what's felt like there's no there's no component tree to have to walk and there's no there's no virtual dom so because of that there's the frameworks like as they exist like they don't have to build upon the old necessarily and so composables are like a way to hook into the reactivity of the library but it's it's not necessary i don't know if every component it feels right for view and react but i'm not sure it feels right for every back in language or a lot of a lot of developers still like maybe thinking about like event based state so being able to instead of reacting to like changes on setters and getters via proxies maybe like you're reacting to an event bus that is independent of whatever language you're in yeah some sort of road is open all right josh you're saying something i interrupted you right so yeah i agree with darren there so yeah basically it's hard to tell the future but given the pattern from other frameworks i think it's not guaranteed that this technique in the technology will be it be present in other frameworks because as for ref and and vjs so we thought that previously we thought that the the best thing was a virtual dom and then suddenly it came up with something yeah it's not predicting so eventually when you're building like a bigger application you run into having to figure out like how you're going to manage all your state and there's historically there's been ux but there has recently been things popping up like pina i think i saw another one on twitter i forget the name of it but some guy created another option do y'all have an opinion on how you manage like state and which state store you use if you use any you have a favorite yeah i've been i've been using vuex from the start and i haven't tried any alternative yet but i only use uh store when i absolutely needed them but for most of my applications i i i just use the local state of the component and then yeah for me view x is enough for what permanent for what i need at least yeah we use ux for options api and then i was looking to migrate my last company to pina and then i was excited to see that it's supplanting view x and this and the like sort of approved index of libraries that vue is supporting so it's becoming the new ux essentially and because of that i think type like because typescript is king like being able to have this typescript tool chain as it relates to state and your components and your templates it's like the golden path where you're able to like change something on the back end and it trickles down across your entire typing system and that was something that we were really hoping to do but volar which is now becoming vue tsc which is the command line utility for the typescript compiler inside of view components so because that didn't exist when i was doing it so pina was nice because it was like okay i might not be able to type check but i can at least hook into the typescript compiler to see the types of my events and see the typings of my store and so if i'm hooking into a mutation or some some event in my my store i can actually see that type and detect problems before they happen speaking of typing one of the differences between view two and view three is just typescript support um in general and so much that it's more of a first class citizen and like a top of my consideration do you plan to use typescript in your newer projects are you like looking forward to it do you plan to go back to your old projects and add typing if you haven't types everywhere that's my opinion i would use typescript everywhere all the time that would be my opinion i'm not really a big fan of typescript at least up until now that i i've been handing projects big projects without typescript it's a headache but yeah i've been actually i've been planning to to to dive into typescript especially went as chart said it became like up so i think i will be forced to you know learn typescript and implement it in uh view stripe view version 3. i think it's a necessity at this point actually i had a question for jeff do you like what's your contributor stuff look like is this a good place to ask people to contribute i have a passion contributor those the ones that are like contributing to the documentation and then i also have contributors that are like fixing some small bugs and some hypographic errors but mostly i do the the most of the works for for my library and i recently charts helped me with implementing one over the element feature in user but yeah most of my contributors are like i would say i would categorize them as like just casual contributors so just for the chat i i need to know because this is almost a bit of a a thing so who's who's team typescript who's just like in the chat if you would ever start a project without typescript please let me know because it seems like at this point pretty much everyone if they're starting a project and typescript support it they're going to start with typescript i myself haven't haven't really dug into it i'm like dropped there but just curious josh i actually want to dive into why you why you're not necessarily a fan of typescript but yeah i guess the words that i use is is wrong i'm not really not a fan but i just don't have enough use cases for me that i usually do things on demand like so if there's no need for something to be done with a specific tool or technology i don't do it because most of my time i'm doing my i'm doing like company projects and then for my free time which is is very little that's the only time that i you know i get to do what i want for my project so for instance in viewstripe so i just decided to do it the way i already know there's no really this is a decision point where i decided that oh no i don't want to use a type script so yes that i didn't really had the luxury of time to to study typescript and then implement it yeah basically just for that reason awesome we are we're nearing we're nearing our time here so one quick we got we have more time of course but let's say evan used to listening the core team's listening what are some what are some areas that you feel the view ecosystem kind of lags behind react angular or like just in general and we can even throw uh svelton there as well first thank you evan if you are listening i am a big fan for sure i've just been super impressed with react's first class with typescript not to be too much of a fanboy but it's just typescript is so nice for putting that into your front end and being able to like flow and have confidence when you make changes especially because you we move so much of our interactivity and logic into the front end i just i i would just say keep investing in typescript support and making sure that it continues to be supported and i'm just like yeah really thankful for all of the initiatives that have gone into supporting it yeah same with me yeah so basically to be honest i'm really satisfied with how things are going right now so i can't really there's to be honest there's no complaint or anything like that from my end but yeah the pacing of the developments is really uh good as well yeah everything's good so no no complaints no wishes that's some high praise so what are some of your favorite view libraries just as like developers of open source projects yourself are there any that you would like to call out for being particularly awesome yeah i was a big ex-state fan at my last company i've contributed a little bit to the composable 4x8 and i think it's a really great library to use and can be used either at this at the global level and like pervading your entire app or it can just be used in a component if you just want to like maintain something like form state and other than that really i have really like loved pina so i would give a plus one opinion as well right so for me i would definitely pick quasar so it's not necessarily like a library or anything but it's it's more of a framework but for so many years i've been trying to develop mobile applications using view and then nothing really suited my tastes but from my experience quasar really is the is the best uh out there i love grazer also beautify so it helped me like it saved us a bunch of time you know developing our ui and uh it's you know basically the just the convenience of having those libraries and frameworks yes awesome and mikey b is shouting out view use which i think i've heard of i'm like looking at its github page and one of its gold sponsors is ebbing you so that's a pretty that's pretty strong endorsement there recently it's great yeah i used it for this like a little app that i built for a cloudflare hackathon so i just linked to the source code but essentially it gives you a bunch of different utils to play with like interactivity one of the the benefits to it is that if you want to play with like animation or any sort of like browser api if you use hooks hooks into those and can like you can pick and choose different pieces like animation or you want to check when the network dropped your users don't have wi-fi anymore or i'm different it's huge so if you go to the docs you'll just see like all the different different things use media queries a popular one where you're detecting that the window sizing is changing and yeah that sounds really nifty so we're drawing near our time it's pretty much we're pretty much at the hour but before we sign off now's the time to do some shout outs so josh is there anything you'd like to share with the audience or talk about right yeah awesome so yeah basically just want to plug a view stripe so i i really need contributors guys so if you if you if you really want to learn videos and also if you have any questions about ggs or anything that you need help with just you can find me on twitter and you can ask me anything yeah darren is there anything you'd like to share with us apart from the stuff we talked about i don't have anything super explicit but randomly i played an amazing video game recently called it takes two and i played it with my nine-year-old and we beat it together and just unprecedented playing experience it's amazing it's got a great story it's funny a lot of fun things so i would plug it takes you awesome i'm gonna have to try i'm about to try that one out i've been looking for a good co-op game and mikey is mikey b like is saying that he would love to contribute to view stripe joff what would be the best way for people to get involved right so first of all they can start with the issues in the issues page so basically if i have time i give i reply to the issues and interact with them there so basically that's that's the only channel that i have right now but twitter is also available awesome you got you have a contributor over here jeff i'm totally gonna come contribute right thanks oh that's great that that's what we like to hear all right joff darren thank you so much for being our guest audience thank you for thank you so much for the awesome questions and just interactivity it sounds like typescript is the way to go by a pretty large margin so again thank you so much for the awesome questions and a huge shout out to my colleagues especially paul in the chat helping out for their help as well as always let us know if you have any feedback we'll see you in this the next stripe dev live next month thank you all so much have a great rest of your day

code check out the video linked in the description [Music] so imagine you're selling books online right now you'd go to the stripe dashboard create a payment link and then share that link on social media after your inventory is exhausted you deactivate the payment link to avoid anyone making further purchases before we create a payment link we need to ensure that our product catalog is set up on stripe for this demo we'll create a new product and a price each time we create a payment link the price will be specified as having inclusive tax behavior that means that when we instruct the payment links api to calculate tax which we'll see in a few moments the tax amount will be inclusive to the total price if you'd like to learn more about getting started with stripe tax you can also see a link for that in the description now we'll create a basic payment link the start will only pass the required line items field it accepts a price in the quantity in addition to releasing the payment links api we're also excited to announce multi-line item support that means that you can create a payment link that will show your customers several products to check out let's follow the link and see the payments page we can improve the payment experience and allow the customer to buy several books at once by enabling adjustable quantities for the line item we can even enable shipping and billing addresses phone number collection promo code support and more all through the single api called the creative payment link as mentioned earlier we can easily add support for automatically calculating collecting taxes let's change the billing address to germany to show that taxes calculated on book sales there and complete the checkout at the end of the payment flow notice that the customer is thanked and that's currently the end of the road for them if we want though we can customize this message or have the customer redirected to a url of our choosing now you see we're redirected to example.com after successfully paying next consider the case where we want to discontinue a product or stop selling books as our inventory is exhausted we can update the payment link and set its active flag to false users who visit that link will be notified that it's no longer active now you can use payment links to kickstart your business or as a compliment to your existing operations you can send payment links through text email or share on social media we're really excited to see what types of new business models this unlocks thanks so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one you\", metadata={'source': 'N_2Il3Uq-3o', 'title': 'Automate your Payment Links with the new Payment Links API', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 6368, 'thumbnail_url':

the next yes framework and one of the quick guide on how to get started with nextgs and payments this is the video for you in this episode we'll go for the basics by showing you how to install an xgs starter app add the striped libraries required initialize stripe gs set up your endpoints and set up a webhook handler if you already have a nexjs app set up and are comfortable setting up new routes and just looking to set up your stripe integration feel free to check out our other videos on this channel where i'll show you how to do exactly that first a quick primer on next.js nexgs is a full stack framework built on node and react focusing on server-side rendering and generating static websites version 12 which was released in october 2021 brought many new exciting features like middleware and a brand new rust compiler to make it even faster than before it's opinionated but don't let that discourage you as it allows you to build websites at breakneck speeds let's jump in and start by installing the next js starter app open up your terminal in this case i'm just using the terminal inside vs code let's run the following command mpx create next app and we'll call it payments next demo now this is using npm's package runner to create a new next.js app without having to first install the create next app package now while this is running a quick note that i'm using node version 16.10.0 if you find you have any problems at any point with the running this demo it's likely going to be your node version all right that's finished now we're going to run first we're going to cd into the holder itself and we're going to run npm run dev we're going to start our server okay that's running let's jump over to chrome look at localhost and there we have it there is next.js running directly in our local environment super easy but this is just the standard next.js sample app so let's explore a little bit more what that looks like i'm going to open up this directory here and here the three folders that we really are interested in is pages public and styles going reverse order styles is the css that we would use in our project public is a lot of static files like our favicon and just a random images and then page is the really important one this is where we find all the content for our site we have an index.js which is that that index screen you just saw which has our react in our html we have an app.js which is our entry point we will mostly leave that alone then we have an api folder which shows a couple well i've chosen example api root so this is just looking here at hello.js this uh just sends a status 200 and some json with the name john doe so let's see how that works if we go back to our browser and do a forward slash api hello and we see there it's returning that json we saw earlier so now let's move on and let's start by installing some of the start dependencies let's stop our server and let's run npm install we're going to install stripe strike gs which is the stripe gs front end we're going to install stripe react stripe js which is our react bindings and we're going to install just right that's node stripe which is our node stripe sdk so let's wait for that to finish all right now in index.js let's import those libraries that we just installed first let us import load stripe from stripe stripe.js and we'll import elements from stripe react.js like so before we go any further with our front end though we're going to need our publisher key and we're going to need our secret key as well eventually so let's look at creating an environmental variable file what's nice about next.js is that if you have an environmental file it'll automatically pick it up let's create a new file in our directory we'll call it env and inside here we're going to put our stripe secret and a publishable key i'm just going to paste this in here but you can get these keys from your dashboard so we have stripe secret key let's try publishable key so now this these dot n files now in our root directory this will be automatically picked up by next yes within your app now we want this to be on our front end therefore we want to create a get route to make sure that our front end can easily request our server for these keys to start in our api folder we're going to create a new file we're going to call it keys.js in here we're going to do export default function handler that's going to have a request and a response we're going to check to see if the request method is a get request and if it is then we're going to do res return status 200 and we're going to return some json as well which is publishable key is process dot n dot stripe publishable key if this is not a get request i'm going to make sure people know that by doing res dot status 405 which means wrong methods and we'll end this with a method not allowed message okay let's give this a test let's start our server and once that is up and running let's go to our browser and we'll go to localhost 3000 api and keys hit enter and yep there we have it there's a publishable key so now we have a get endpoint which returns our publishable key excellent let's go back to index.js and now let's use some of these libraries that we imported so what we're going to do here to make sure that our stripe library runs at the very first thing we do is use a hook from react we're going to use the use effect hook use effect means that it will run immediately as the component begins to render so within our home function here we're going to say use effect and then immediately invoke function expression and we're going to immediately fetch our api keys so we'll say fetch keys and we're going to pass in some options like friction where we are using the get method very important and we'll pass in some headers as well to make sure that we are using oops content type equals application json and after that has fetched we're going to then make sure that it is converted to json and then finally we have some data and for now all we're going to do is console.log that data to make sure that it works so let's save this go back to chrome let's remove these queries at the end here open up our dev tools and we see here already that it logged our publishable key cool so that worked so now that we have that data what are we going to do with it well we're going to use another hook from react this one is called use state which is going to update our state and re-render our component when required so to begin up here we're going to say const publishable key and set publishable key equals use states and this argument this function takes a default and we're just going to default it to an empty string then in here rather than logging things we're going to run that setpublishablekey function with data. publishable key then finally before we test this out let's make sure that if publishable key doesn't exist we return a string that says loading class part is pretty important because while use effect is running asynchronously we want to make sure that we have a publishable key before we do anything with it so if our publisher is not ready yet we want to delay loading our component this will ensure that happens okay so earlier we have this load stripe method now we're actually going to use it because we have a publishable key ready to do that we're going to initialize stripe.js by running const stripe equals load stripe and the publishable key like so and we're going to save this and let's see if this has worked so what load stripe is going to do is it's going to inject stripe gs into our header and start loading the library this actually returns a promise so let's see if that worked so already if i tab back in here i see that i some warnings from stripe just telling me that i need to run it over https and live mode this is totally fine it's just a warning when you deploy this into a live environment using https that'll go away so if i look into our elements and i open up the head and here i see we have our javascript drive.js being loaded correctly automatically injected into the head very cool all right so now our front end has strap just loaded we have our elements we're not going to be using this just yet but that's okay we'll use that in a future video next up we're going to look at creating a post endpoint and a webhook handler so weblogs are useful as it's how stripe informs you about an action that happened on your account for instance a successful payment or a new customer is created so we have many videos or web hooks on this channel so i suggest you give those a watch but here's a quick primer on how to get set up with next gs first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a new webhook endpoint which is going to be a part of an api endpoint so not unlike how we created our keys endpoint earlier we're going to create a new one here we're going to call it webhooks.js and in here again export default function webhook handler with a request under response and we're going to say if the method was a post this time around then we're just going to log it out it's going to log wrap that body all right now how do we test this well we could just hit this endpoint ourselves obviously by writing a fetch function but instead we're going to be using the stripe vs code extension if you haven't got this installed i highly recommend it to install it you can just go to your extensions tab here type in stripe and the very top result right here once you've installed it you get this fun little stripe logo over here which i'm going to click on right now and to get things running first what we want to do is we want to forward events to our local machine so we click on that we determine where we're going to be sent this is already set at the correct place make sure it's local hosts three thousand slash api slash webhooks and hit enter and hit enter again to confirm and what's this gonna do you see that uses the striped cli in our terminal to set up this endpoint all right that's done you might notice the webhook signing secret over here we'll be needing that later for now we can just leave that now we're going to trigger a new default event let's click here and we're just going to do payment intent that's exceeded which is a successful payment hit enter here we see that the stripe cli has sent an event we'll go back to our terminal and here we see from our server the that got logged to this event we have a couple actually we've got payment intent created and we got a payment and succeeded and a charge succeeded all right so all that's come in however we have one problem with this this seems to be working nicely however we have a bit of a security hole here so we don't know where this request came from anyone could potentially hit this endpoint and trick your integration into doing something that you perhaps don't want it to so we need to ensure that these workbooks are actually coming from stripe now luckily there is a great way to do that it's called signature signing with your web hooks so we're going to implement that we're going to start by grabbing the signing secret that we saw in our terminal over here and we're going to put that into our environmental variables i'm going to say stripe webhook signing oops signing secret equals this i'm going to save that and within our web hooks here we're going to change this so that we now can be using that signing secret to cryptographically verify that these web hooks came from stripe and to start what we're going to do is import some new libraries we're going to start with the stripe library this is stripe sd node sdk and we're going to want a new library also from the varicell guys so we're just going to go to our terminal over here we're going to quit our server i'm going to do npm install micro now while that's running micro is just a small light utility library also built by versailles the guys who made next js and this has a bunch of helper methods for your server which we're going to use and the one thing we're particularly interested in is the buffer function from micro okay next up one thing that nexges tries to do to be as helpful as possible because nextgs is running express under the hood is parse every single response that comes through our server to be json parsed now normally this is very useful however in this case we want the raw request body from stripe to be able to verify the signature so we first are going to have to tell nexjs to stop using a body parasite i'm going to do that by export const config which is an object which has another object in it called api and we're going to say body parser false now what's nice about nextgs is that this little config file is specific to this api root which means that turning off the body parser is only going to affect this route and not any of your other routes very cool now in our web camera we're going to change this to be an async function we're going to get rid of this console.log and we are going to first initialize our stripe library like so i'm going to take process dot n dot stripe secret key because we need a secret key on our back end all right within our if statement we need to get the buffer payload which is we're going to use buffer quest that's going to grab us the raw payload for this particular web hook event we need the signing signature which is going to be rec headers stripe signature if this does come from stripe this will exist and we're going to need our web webhook secret which as we put earlier is in process dot n dot i've forgotten the exact what i've put earlier so we're just going to copy paste this which is probably better there we go and we're going to create define an event now we're going to do a little try catch here because this sometimes can go wrong and we want to be able to log into sort of errors that come in so first we're going to do in our try catch if signature doesn't exist as in this didn't come from stripe or if we don't have a webhook signing secret then we just want to return then we're going to define our event as stripe.webhooks.construct event i'm going to add in the payload the signature and the workbook secret if there's an error something went wrong here we are going to first log it for our purpose we're going to say webhook error and we're just going to say error.message to tell us exactly what went wrong then we will return res dot status we'll say it's a 400 and we're going to send the exact same thing so we'll send webhook error and the error message itself it's very important to return an error status here to the stripe api if something went wrong because that in that tells stripe that something is incorrect which means that stripe will try your web hook event again later and then finally after that we are going to just log out the event itself just so we can see that it worked and afterwards we will make sure that we return by sending a 200 response and we'll send now it's very very important to actually send this 200 response once your payload has been successfully received by your input reason being if stripe gets anything but a 200 response back it'll just assume that the webhook event failed and will try to reset resend at a later point once there are enough failures over a period of time stripe will automatically disable your webhook endpoint so please do make sure to return this 200 status code in your code okay let's give that a go so we're going to run our server stripes should already be set up and listening to the correct endpoint so let's trigger under default lens we'll do payment intent succeeded again right that run let's go over here and we see we have our events being logged out as we expect and what's cool about this now is that this is now verified to be coming from stripe and there's no potential for a man-in-the-middle attack on our server so we can be fairly confident in fact very confident that this came from stripe tarika in this episode we learned how to create an xjs app how to import the required stripe libraries how to create roots with next.js and how to set up a web hook endpoint so that does it for this episode if you enjoyed what you saw please consider hitting like and subscribe or check out any other videos on

invoicing you can create and manage invoices from one-time payments for your customers and now the stripe taxes integrated with invoicing you can also automatically calculate the amount of tax owed on the products and services that you're selling in this episode you'll learn how to create an invoice and collect taxes and you'll see that both through the dashboard and through the api [Music] if you haven't already seen how to enable stripe tags for your business you can watch the getting started video linked in the description so let's jump in first let's create a product to sell and at a price let's say your company sells downloadable games and you've just released a great new game called startup scramble it sells for a one-time price of 10 euros here you can specify that the calculated tax is inclusive or exclusive this is called the tax behavior meaning that the tax is either included in the final price of 10 euros or the tax should be added on to the original price in this case let's specify that tax is exclusive meaning that in ireland 2 euros 30 will be added to the original price as the vat rate for downloadable games in ireland is 23 now let's create an invoice first let's choose a customer to charge a customer has already been created who's located in ireland so tax will be calculated based on irish tax rates customers outside of the us need at least a country level address while customers in the u.s require a five-digit postal code for canada we need at least the province or postal code but in this case my customer is in ireland then let's sell an instance of startup scramble by adding it as a line item it's possible at this point to override the tax behavior to be inclusive but let's leave it as exclusive as we specified when creating the price when creating an invoice with more than one line item you can specify different tax codes so if you're selling downloadable games taxed at 23 in ireland along with something that's non-taxable or taxed at a different rate that's possible when we save the line item we can see that stripe tax has included an additional 23 vat on top of the price making a total of 12 euros and 30 cents and that's it once the invoice is charged automatically or sent to the customer tax will be included in the final amount so let's move on to creating an invoice through the api and using stripe tax to automatically calculate and collect taxes the first thing we'll do is create an invoice item using the same customer and price that we used previously then we'll create an invoice for that customer that will pull in that invoice item here we're telling stripe to auto advance the invoice meaning that it will be automatically finalized in an hour's time and that we would like the invoice to be charged automatically and finally let's specify that the invoice should also collect tax by setting automatic tax enabled to true when using the api stripe tax uses the prices configured inclusive or exclusive tax behavior when calculating tax when we run this code an invoice will be created let's jump into the dashboard and inspect it great the invoice has been created and 23 fat has been calculated automatically based on the line item and the location of your customer and we're done so now you're fully equipped to automatically calculate and collect tax on your invoices using stripe

'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"welcome to our web series shipt where we talk about stripes and newest features and integrations or ships i'm charles a developer advocate here at shripe you may have heard that stripe is working on an expanded set of embeddable ui components the first of those components is the payment element to get an inside look at how the payment element works and why we built it i'm here with christopher hen christopher is a software engineer on the payment elements team and he's here to tell us about the payment element integration so i'll kick this off by first welcoming christopher welcome we're so happy to have you can you tell us a bit more about the payment element what is it and why should developers be excited hey charles thanks for having me on the show uh so the stripe elements is our set of embeddable ui components you can drop them on your site and they match the look and feel of your site exactly while still securely collecting payment uh so today we're launching the payment element which is a single element that can collect payment details for a variety of different payment methods with a single integration and this will help you acquire new customers increase conversion without having higher engineering costs wow the payment element sounds like a very comprehensive and straightforward way to integrate payments and it's customizable too uh so where does this sam with the other elements is this the go-to integration for users who are interested in integrating multiple payment methods or is this for everyone including the people who are only interested in integrating say cards even if you're just using cards you should use the payment element it's our newest element it's the best thing we've got so far it's where we're going to continue to focus a lot of effort developing forward and it offers a great experience just for cards so if you're just getting started out with stripe i would recommend the payment element okay so it sounds like if you're not integrating with checkout but you are integrating payments on a custom form the payment element is the best option it also sounds like there are going to be some updates coming to the payment element in the future that makes sense um it also sounds like it's future proof it's a time statement approach irrespective of whether you're planning to launch new payment methods or not and that's great um this sounds like a whole lot of awesome but what's the catch is the payment element uh wildly different in terms of integration effort or integration shape do i need to use a different api or otherwise learn new concepts to get started it's actually really similar to integrating the card element today so if you integrate card element with our default integration the payment element integration is going to look very similar it's built on payment intents that uses stripe.js so it's a very very similar feel i would say overall the difficulty of integrating the payment element is about on par with what it takes to integrate the card element today you just get more as a result okay well uh what are some of the differences between the payment element and the card element they do sound really really similar but i'm wondering how similar the payment element could be since it supports so many payment methods some payment methods for example like bank redirects are redirect based and that's different from how cards work so how does the payment element account for differences like that sure yeah yeah so the biggest difference of the payment element is that instead of just rendering inputs to collect card information it'll let you select what payment method you want and then when you do select a payment method it's going to display a form to collect all the necessary details just for that payment method in terms of what's different i think you know it's a little bit more of a ui it's an entire form rather than just a single input and i think that means that the styling is a little bit different we've got a new api for styling it uh but all together like stripe generally handles like all that extra complexity that comes with that like displaying validation errors like we'll handle it or validating you know masking input anything like that it's completely handled by the element wow it sounds like there are a lot of payment methods uh that's incredible and it also sounds like there are a lot of payment methods that are going to be supported by the payment element out of the box since it supports all different types of like flows and it can support all those different payment methods um are there any payment methods that we can look forward to in the future whether that's like the near future or the distant future for example i know we've been launching payment methods even as your team has been working on the payment element absolutely yeah so today we support uh 17 different payment methods and we're planning to basically add any payment method that is supported on stripe we want it in the element so near term that's going to be acs so if you want to accept canadian pre-authorized debits uh we are also adding um karna too a popular payment method in europe but in general in the future we're going to add support for all the payment methods that we have ah it's great to hear that you plan to support all the payment methods going forward with this integration and that will be future-proof uh it really sounds like you can integrate once and then a stripe you know builds new features and adds new payment methods you can just turn them on by like tweaking your integration a bit absolutely it's a single integration you want to add a payment method once we add support for it you just add a single line of code or in some cases you don't even add any code at all you can just go in the dashboard and turn it on speaking of the dashboard so using the dashboard to turn on payments that's the automatic payment methods feature right can you tell us a little bit more about it yeah absolutely so the idea behind automatic payment methods is that once you have a payment element integration or even if you've integrated stripe checkout and you want to enable additional payment methods currently you have to make a code change to do that we're working on making that code change as small as possible in some cases it's adding a single line of code but we want to make that even easier so what's better than a single line of code is just no change at all so the way that works is that if you want to add extra payment methods you go to your stripe dashboard where you can learn what the payment methods are that stripe offers what are their different characteristics what sort of businesses they make sense for and then right there in the dashboard you can turn them on with a single click and then in your existing integration that you've already done with the payment element they'll just appear automatically wow as someone who's had to integrate multiple payment methods before being able to turn on payment methods on or out off by pressing a button sounds like a lifesaver overall it sounds like the payment element is the way to go if you're integrating a customized payment form i'm really looking forward to trying it out especially the automatic payment methods feature thanks for joining us christopher it's been awesome learning about automatic payment methods it's been an absolute blast thanks for joining us and we'll see you in the next one thanks for having me charles

to integrate the new stripe payment element let's get started [Music] i'm starting here with the node starter which is generated using stripe cli sample command if you need help getting this set up see our video linked in the description on the node starter video in this channel so in order to integrate the payment element we're going to need to create two resources on our back end first we're going to need a route handler so that we can retrieve our publishable key and we need the publishable key so that we can initialize stripe.js on the front end we're also going to need a client secret and we're going to use the client secret so that we can initialize the payment element i'm going to start by adding a new route handler and this route handler is going to allow us to get our publishable key we'll call route publishable key and we'll just return our publishable key next we're going to create a route to create a payment intent and return its client secret we'll just call this secret and because i'm using the stripe vs code extension i can type in payment intent and i'll see a list of options for commands that i can run against the payment intents api and the code that you need to do them so in my case i want to create a payment intent i'm going to change the currency to euro and i'm going to update this function to be asynchronous and finally i'm just going to make sure that we return our client secret from the payment intent okay that completes our backend we have everything we need we have a home page that the node starter comes with and that's just going to be where our checkout form lives we have a complete page that's where the payment element is going to redirect to after a successful payment we have an endpoint to retrieve our publishable t and we also have an endpoint to create a payment incent and then return its client secret next let's hop into the front end so that we can actually do the work of integrating the payment element let's build out our front end so you'll see that we have a really basic page here it's a form it doesn't have any inputs instead we're going to mount the payment element and it also has a single button we're going to add an event listener so that when you click that button it passes the payment method information that's inside of the payment element and sends it to stripe so let's get started we've navigated back to vs code we're in index.html this is the html file of the page you just saw it has stripe.js it has a really basic form this is pretty much all we're going to be working with this form this payment element div and this button and so what we're going to do is we're going to put all of our javascript in this uh script element we are just going to add an event listener and we're going to wait for the dom content to have loaded now after the dom content has loaded what we'll want to do is first fetch the publishable key and the reason we want to do that is so that we can initialize stripe.js so we'll use that publishable key endpoint that we created and then once we have the publishable key we're able to initialize right we'll do that second third we're going to need our client secret so we're going to fetch the client secret and the reason we're going to do that is because the client secret is required to create the payment element so we're going to just reuse the code we have here and make some small adjustments we want the client secret we want to use the secret endpoint we want to use the post method and then fourth we want to create and mount the payment element first we're going to make an instance of elements so we'll do stripe.elements and then we're going to create a payment element specifically using element.create specify the element type and pass in the client secret as our last step we're going to mount the payment element calling payment element amounts and then just passing in the id of the element that we want to mount to so in that case it's payment element for us this empty div right here now this should be enough for us to at least see the payment element on our page so let's navigate back and take a look so right now it's empty and when we refresh we should see it and we have a basic card element hasn't been styled yet but this is a fully functional element well it almost is a fully functional element we haven't added an event listener to the pay button yet so we can fill out all of the form inputs here but it won't send any payment information to stripe so let's do that as our fifth and last step for our base build out step number five we are going to add an event listener and submit payment information to stripe tokenized of course the uh the element tokenizes it let's start by getting the form and we can do that by using the query selector we are going to get the payment form now once we have the payment form we can add an event listener and we'll listen for submit and we're going to prevent the default behavior and instead what we'll do is we'll call stripe dot confirm payment and we're going to pass in this object we're going to pass in the element and that's going to be the payment element and we're also going to pass in the confirm params and within the confirm params we're going to pass in a return url and the return url is just going to be uh complete because we create we created a route handler for complete we have a really basic thank you page after customer completes the payment form they'll be redirected there and i'll get a nice little thank you message we have our event listener we have our event listener on the submit button we are going to confirm the card payment when someone completes the form and then clicks the button so let's give it a whirl if we type in the 4242 test card we should be able to successfully complete this payment and get redirected and it works now if you want to integrate with cards you're done but of course that's just a start

implement the front end using html and javascript to accept a one-time payment using sepa debit which allows for the direct debiting of euro denominated bank accounts in order to debit an account customers must accept a mandate that gives the business the authorization to do so let's say you already have a back-end set up it's a great payment intent and you'd like to add support for accepting sap debit payments on the front end if you haven't already implemented a back-end head over and take a look at one of our server implementations in one of our officially supported languages our backend is up and running and has two endpoints that we'll interact with today one is config for fetching publishable keys and the other is a post request to create payment intents this endpoint will take two arguments payment method type and currency and the endpoint returns a client secret that we can use to confirm the payment on the front end so let's open index.html and get to work before we write any javascript the page needs a form where a customer can enter some billing details like their name and email address and a div where we can mount the iban element i'm pre-publishing the name and email so that we don't need to fill it out every time we test and i'll add an empty div where we'll mount the iban element and we need a submit button as well to send the form when we click pay the separa rules require that a mandate is displayed to the user which must be accepted in order to authorize the payment i have taken the mandate text from the stripe docs on sepa debit we'll add a simple div below our form for debugging so that we can see some logging information without needing to open the console we're almost ready to jump into some javascript but first let's install stripe.js stripe.js should always be loaded directly from js.stripe.com and it's best practice to load it on every page next we'll add a reference to sepa.js to handle the form submission and payment confirmation if we reload the browser we should see our form fields and pay button jumping into sepa.js let's do some setup i'm dropping in this little helper function for logging to the messages div this is purely for demonstration we grab a reference to the div then set it to display and add some inner html with the string of the message we'll also console log the message so we have a chance to see it in multiple places so finally it's time for the main part of this demo we start with a wrapper so that our code only runs when the dom is fully loaded and then we initialize stripe the stripe constructor function comes from stripe.js which we installed earlier and it expects the publishable key as the first argument you can find your api keys in the stripe dashboard stripe.js provides a specific i-band element that will display an iban input field the i-band element should be configured with an options hash that specifies that the supported countries are all in the separa region we can set a placeholder country in this case ireland and also provide some basic styling when the form is submitted we prevent the default action so that the browser doesn't reload next we make an ajax call to the server to create a payment intent and store the result there are several libraries and packages that help with making ajax requests you might be using jquery axios or something similar but in our case we're using the browser's native fetch api to avoid any extra dependencies here we'll specify the payment method type and currency in this demo we're showing how to accept payment payments using sepa debit but in other videos in the series you'll see how to accept other payment method types like alipay ideal support and more it's also worth mentioning that technically you could hard code the list of supported payment method types in your backend but our server expects that we pass the payment method type and currency so that we can demonstrate the widest variety of payment method types we'll also add some logging now that we have the client secret we'll confirm the payment confirm sabadeb payment expects the client secret from the payment intent the iban element and an options block with payment method details in this case the name of the email that we collected in the form earlier when the result is returned we'll log the payment intent status to the messages div so let's try that out if i provide a valid i-band and click pay will see the payment intent being created and eventually the payment intent state is being reported as processing that's because notification for a separate debit can take up to 14 days and that's where web hooks are really useful and you can check out episodes on web hooks in our channel if we jump into the dashboard we can see the successful setup payment one last bit of cleanup let's load the publishable key from the server with an ajax call and use that to initialize stripe we'll pass the constant to the constructor so let's quickly test again to make sure everything is asked before in review we first created an html form for users to enter some billing details and a div to mount the iban elements on next we initialized stripe created and mounted on iban elements and added a form handler to create a payment intent where we passed the currency and the payment method type to the server finally we confirm that payment intent client side with stripe.js using the client secret from the payment intent so now you're fully equipped to build a custom payment flow to accept a one-time separate debit payment with stripe watch

Document(page_content=\"welcome to our web series shipt where we talk about stripes and newest features and integrations or ships i'm charles a developer advocate here at shripe you may have heard that stripe is working on an expanded set of embeddable ui components the first of those components is the payment element to get an inside look at how the payment element works and why we built it i'm here with christopher hen christopher is a software engineer on the payment elements team and he's here to tell us about the payment element integration so i'll kick this off by first welcoming christopher welcome we're so happy to have you can you tell us a bit more about the payment element what is it and why should developers be excited hey charles thanks for having me on the show uh so the stripe elements is our set of embeddable ui components you can drop them on your site and they match the look and feel of your site exactly while still securely collecting payment uh so today we're launching the payment element which is a single element that can collect payment details for a variety of different payment methods with a single integration and this will help you acquire new customers increase conversion without having higher engineering costs wow the payment element sounds like a very comprehensive and straightforward way to integrate payments and it's customizable too uh so where does this sam with the other elements is this the go-to integration for users who are interested in integrating multiple payment methods or is this for everyone including the people who are only interested in integrating say cards even if you're just using cards you should use the payment element it's our newest element it's the best thing we've got so far it's where we're going to continue to focus a lot of effort developing forward and it offers a great experience just for cards so if you're just getting started out with stripe i would recommend the payment element okay so it sounds like if you're not integrating with checkout but you are integrating payments on a custom form the payment element is the best option it also sounds like there are going to be some updates coming to the payment element in the future that makes sense um it also sounds like it's future proof it's a time statement approach irrespective of whether you're planning to launch new payment methods or not and that's great um this sounds like a whole lot of awesome but what's the catch is the payment element uh wildly different in terms of integration effort or integration shape do i need to use a different api or otherwise learn new concepts to get started it's actually really similar to integrating the card element today so if you integrate card element with our default integration the payment element integration is going to look very similar it's built on payment intents that uses stripe.js so it's a very very similar feel i would say overall the difficulty of integrating the payment element is about on par with what it takes to integrate the card element today you just get more as a result okay well uh what are some of the differences between the payment element and the card element they do sound really really similar but i'm wondering how similar the payment element could be since it supports so many payment methods some payment methods for example like bank redirects are redirect based and that's different from how cards work so how does the payment element account for differences like that sure yeah yeah so the biggest difference of the payment element is that instead of just rendering inputs to collect card information it'll let you select what payment method you want and then when you do select a payment method it's going to display a form to collect all the necessary details just for that payment method in terms of what's different i think you know it's a little bit more of a ui it's an entire form rather than just a single input and i think that means that the styling is a little bit different we've got a new api for styling it uh but all together like stripe generally handles like all that extra complexity that comes with that like displaying validation errors like we'll handle it or validating you know masking input anything like that it's completely handled by the element wow it sounds like there are a lot of payment methods uh that's incredible and it also sounds like there are a lot of payment methods that are going to be supported by the payment element out of the box since it supports all different types of like flows and it can support all those different payment methods um are there any payment methods that we can look forward to in the future whether that's like the near future or the distant future for example i know we've been launching payment methods even as your team has been working on the payment element absolutely yeah so today we support uh 17 different payment methods and we're planning to basically add any payment method that is supported on stripe we want it in the element so near term that's going to be acs so if you want to accept canadian pre-authorized debits uh we are also adding um karna too a popular payment method in europe but in general in the future we're going to add support for all the payment methods that we have ah it's great to hear that you plan to support all the payment methods going forward with this integration and that will be future-proof uh it really sounds like you can integrate once and then a stripe you know builds new features and adds new payment methods you can just turn them on by like tweaking your integration a bit absolutely it's a single integration you want to add a payment method once we add support for it you just add a single line of code or in some cases you don't even add any code at all you can just go in the dashboard and turn it on speaking of the dashboard so using the dashboard to turn on payments that's the automatic payment methods feature right can you tell us a little bit more about it yeah absolutely so the idea behind automatic payment methods is that once you have a payment element integration or even if you've integrated stripe checkout and you want to enable additional payment methods currently you have to make a code change to do that we're working on making that code change as small as possible in some cases it's adding a single line of code but we want to make that even easier so what's better than a single line of code is just no change at all so the way that works is that if you want to add extra payment methods you go to your stripe dashboard where you can learn what the payment methods are that stripe offers what are their different characteristics what sort of businesses they make sense for and then right there in the dashboard you can turn them on with a single click and then in your existing integration that you've already done with the payment element they'll just appear automatically wow as someone who's had to integrate multiple payment methods before being able to turn on payment methods on or out off by pressing a button sounds like a lifesaver overall it sounds like the payment element is the way to go if you're integrating a customized payment form i'm really looking forward to trying it out especially the automatic payment methods feature thanks for joining us christopher it's been awesome learning about automatic payment methods it's been an absolute blast thanks for joining us and we'll see you in the next one thanks for having me charles

to integrate the new stripe payment element let's get started [Music] i'm starting here with the node starter which is generated using stripe cli sample command if you need help getting this set up see our video linked in the description on the node starter video in this channel so in order to integrate the payment element we're going to need to create two resources on our back end first we're going to need a route handler so that we can retrieve our publishable key and we need the publishable key so that we can initialize stripe.js on the front end we're also going to need a client secret and we're going to use the client secret so that we can initialize the payment element i'm going to start by adding a new route handler and this route handler is going to allow us to get our publishable key we'll call route publishable key and we'll just return our publishable key next we're going to create a route to create a payment intent and return its client secret we'll just call this secret and because i'm using the stripe vs code extension i can type in payment intent and i'll see a list of options for commands that i can run against the payment intents api and the code that you need to do them so in my case i want to create a payment intent i'm going to change the currency to euro and i'm going to update this function to be asynchronous and finally i'm just going to make sure that we return our client secret from the payment intent okay that completes our backend we have everything we need we have a home page that the node starter comes with and that's just going to be where our checkout form lives we have a complete page that's where the payment element is going to redirect to after a successful payment we have an endpoint to retrieve our publishable t and we also have an endpoint to create a payment incent and then return its client secret next let's hop into the front end so that we can actually do the work of integrating the payment element let's build out our front end so you'll see that we have a really basic page here it's a form it doesn't have any inputs instead we're going to mount the payment element and it also has a single button we're going to add an event listener so that when you click that button it passes the payment method information that's inside of the payment element and sends it to stripe so let's get started we've navigated back to vs code we're in index.html this is the html file of the page you just saw it has stripe.js it has a really basic form this is pretty much all we're going to be working with this form this payment element div and this button and so what we're going to do is we're going to put all of our javascript in this uh script element we are just going to add an event listener and we're going to wait for the dom content to have loaded now after the dom content has loaded what we'll want to do is first fetch the publishable key and the reason we want to do that is so that we can initialize stripe.js so we'll use that publishable key endpoint that we created and then once we have the publishable key we're able to initialize right we'll do that second third we're going to need our client secret so we're going to fetch the client secret and the reason we're going to do that is because the client secret is required to create the payment element so we're going to just reuse the code we have here and make some small adjustments we want the client secret we want to use the secret endpoint we want to use the post method and then fourth we want to create and mount the payment element first we're going to make an instance of elements so we'll do stripe.elements and then we're going to create a payment element specifically using element.create specify the element type and pass in the client secret as our last step we're going to mount the payment element calling payment element amounts and then just passing in the id of the element that we want to mount to so in that case it's payment element for us this empty div right here now this should be enough for us to at least see the payment element on our page so let's navigate back and take a look so right now it's empty and when we refresh we should see it and we have a basic card element hasn't been styled yet but this is a fully functional element well it almost is a fully functional element we haven't

implement the front end using html and javascript to accept a one-time payment using sepa debit which allows for the direct debiting of euro denominated bank accounts in order to debit an account customers must accept a mandate that gives the business the authorization to do so let's say you already have a back-end set up it's a great payment intent and you'd like to add support for accepting sap debit payments on the front end if you haven't already implemented a back-end head over and take a look at one of our server implementations in one of our officially supported languages our backend is up and running and has two endpoints that we'll interact with today one is config for fetching publishable keys and the other is a post request to create payment intents this endpoint will take two arguments payment method type and currency and the endpoint returns a client secret that we can use to confirm the payment on the front end so let's open index.html and get to work before we write any javascript the page needs a form where a customer can enter some billing details like their name and email address and a div where we can mount the iban element i'm pre-publishing the name and email so that we don't need to fill it out every time we test and i'll add an empty div where we'll mount the iban element and we need a submit button as well to send the form when we click pay the separa rules require that a mandate is displayed to the user which must be accepted in order to authorize the payment i have taken the mandate text from the stripe docs on sepa debit we'll add a simple div below our form for debugging so that we can see some logging information without needing to open the console we're almost ready to jump into some javascript but first let's install stripe.js stripe.js should always be loaded directly from js.stripe.com and it's best practice to load it on every page next we'll add a reference to sepa.js to handle the form submission and payment confirmation if we reload the browser we should see our form fields and pay button jumping into sepa.js let's do some setup i'm dropping in this little helper function for logging to the messages div this is purely for demonstration we grab a reference to the div then set it to display and add some inner html with the string of the message we'll also console log the message so we have a chance to see it in multiple places so finally it's time for the main part of this demo we start with a wrapper so that our code only runs when the dom is fully loaded and then we initialize stripe the stripe constructor function comes from stripe.js which we installed earlier and it expects the publishable key as the first argument you can find your api keys in the stripe dashboard stripe.js provides a specific i-band element that will display an iban input field the i-band element should be configured with an options hash that specifies that the supported countries are all in the separa region we can set a placeholder country in this case ireland and also provide some basic styling when the form is submitted we prevent the default action so that the browser doesn't reload next we make an ajax call to the server to create a payment intent and store the result there are several libraries and packages that help with making ajax requests you might be using jquery axios or something similar but in our case we're using the browser's native fetch api to avoid any extra dependencies here we'll specify the payment method type and currency in this demo we're showing how to accept payment payments using sepa debit but in other videos in the series you'll see how to accept other payment method types like alipay ideal support and more it's also worth mentioning that technically you could hard code the list of supported payment method types in your backend but our server expects that we pass the payment method type and currency so that we can demonstrate the widest variety of payment method types we'll also add some logging now that we have the client secret we'll confirm the payment confirm sabadeb payment expects the client secret from the payment intent the iban element and an options block with payment method details in this case the name of the email that we collected in the form earlier when the result is returned we'll log the payment intent status to the messages div so let's try that out if i provide a valid i-band and click pay will see the payment intent being created and eventually the payment intent state is being reported as processing that's because notification for a separate debit can take up to 14 days and that's where web hooks are really useful and you can check out episodes on web hooks in our channel if we jump into the dashboard we can see the successful setup payment one last bit of cleanup let's load the publishable key from the server with an ajax call and use that to initialize stripe we'll pass the constant to the constructor so let's quickly test again to make sure everything is asked before in review we first created an html form for users to enter some billing details and a div to mount the iban elements on next we initialized stripe created and mounted on iban elements and added a form handler to create a payment intent where we passed the currency and the payment method type to the server finally we confirm that payment intent client side with stripe.js using the client secret from the payment intent so now you're fully equipped to build a custom payment flow to accept a one-time separate debit payment with stripe watch

Document(page_content=\"in this video we're going to be using the stripe api postman collection and we're going to look at how you can set an api version when you make your requests to start we'll look at how versioning works with the stripe api in general and then we'll come back and apply those concepts to postman if you've already watched this overview in another video and would like to skip ahead check out the chapter markers in this video's description the stripe api is versioned and you can think of your api version as a contract you have with the api it defines how you call the api what functionality you have access to and what you're guaranteed to get back as part of the response we've versioned the stripe api so that we can continue to release new features without breaking existing integrations or requiring developers to immediately upgrade in this video we're going to talk about how the stripe api version is defined and how the api evolves we'll look at how the api version is initially set on your account and what options you have for controlling the versions you use in your integration we'll also look at web hooks and how those interact with api versions the stripe api version is denoted by the date that that version of the api was released so for example march 14 2019 or august 27 2020 now as you're reading our docs or working on your integration you may encounter other version references these versions aren't stripe api versions and they're not something we're going to talk about during this video but before we go any further let's give them names so that we're all on the same page here are some of the types of versions we're not going to discuss today the v1 you may see in the endpoint path while this may change in the future all of our endpoints currently have the same v1 reference the version referenced in the stripe.js path at the time of this recording this stripe.js was on its third version lastly all of our client libraries have their own versioning stripe api evolves in two ways backwards compatible changes and backwards incompatible changes backwards compatible changes are changes you can take advantage of regardless of what api version you're currently on these might take the form of new properties on existing resources and in some cases new resources themselves a good example of this would be the prices object that we rolled out earlier backwards incompatible changes often happen when we change when we remove a property from a resource we change the type of that property or the behavior of that resource fundamentally changes in these cases you have to upgrade to that api version to take advantage of these changes a good example of this would be a change we made in february of 2019 where we dramatically changed how the accounts api behaved in connect by default all requests from your application will use the api version set on your account unless you or the client library you're using overrides that we recommend being explicit about what api version you're using this will allow you to better understand how you might have to upgrade your integration as we release new api versions with new features if you're using one of our libraries in a dynamically typed language such as ruby php python or node you can set the api version on a per request basis or globally if you're using one of our libraries in a statically typed language such as java go or dot net the api version is pinned to the version of the client library that you're using for this demo i've already forked the stripe api collection from stripe's public workspace into my own workspace and i've set my api key as an environment variable if you haven't done these two things yet check out our installation and authentication episodes so in this example i'm using a stripe account that's set to an api version from the fall of 2019 but i want to make my requests using the most current api version at the time of this recording which is from august of 2020. to start let's create a customer without setting an api version at all and see what that response looks like when the call uses the api version set on my stripe account so we'll come over to the customers folder in the collection and we'll click on create a customer and we'll look at the body and we're just going to click send we'll take a look at the customer response that was returned to us here and if we scroll through it a bit we can see that it's um that it's a quite lengthy and at the bottom of the response we can see these three hashes that are empty because we just created this customer for sources for subscriptions and then there's one more down here for tax ids and i point these out because in the 2020 api we changed what we returned in this response to make it more compact and we removed returning these hashes so this is a really good like visual example of you know trying a different api call and seeing how the um how the response changes with those different api versions that you set so within postman we can set the version either globally for the whole collection or we can set it on a per request basis let's start by setting it globally so we're going to come back to our collection and the first thing i want to do is create a variable that will hold the api version that i want to use so i'll come over to variables and add an api version variable and i'm going to set it to 2020 august 27th i'll save that and then to use this api version for all of the requests in the collection i can set this as a header in a pre pre-request script so let's take this variable and do that now so i'll click on my pre-request script tab and make a call to set the header so request headers add we're going to set the key of the header to be a stripe version and the value to be the value of that collection variable i just created api version we'll go ahead and save this missing our get retrieve that go ahead and save this and now let's go back to our create a customer call we'll send it again and this time if we look at the response that's returned to us we could see that it's a lot more compact those hashes aren't there and if we click over into the headers for the response we can see that the stripe version was set in this header in this request and set to 2020 august 27th so so that was how we would set the version if we wanted to apply it for all of our requests within the collection it might be that you don't want to apply it for all requests and you just want to apply it on a per request basis and we can do that by just setting this header manually within this request so let's go ahead and take out our script we'll leave the variable because we're still going to use that we'll come back to our create a customer request click on headers and this time we want to add the header here in the header list so stripe version 08 27 we'll click send again oh i didn't quite get it there and once again we have a customer returned to us with the 2020 api response shape and if we look at the headers we can see that again we passed the stripe version header [Music] [Applause] [Music] you\",

to make requests using the stripe api postman collection this is actually the second video of a two-part video series and so if you haven't watched the introductory video yet i encourage you to start with that video in this video we're going to look at how to pass arrays or lists of data how to pass nested parameters and we'll also take a look at how to pass additional parameters that you don't see listed by default in the body of the request to get started i've already gone ahead and forked the collection from the stripe public workspace into my own personal workspace and i've set my api key as an environment variable if you haven't done these two things yet check out our installation and authentication episodes so let's get started by passing a list of data in a request and we're going to use the create a customer call as our example request so we'll go into the collection and click on create a customer and when we look through the parameters that are available to us in this request we can see this one parameter called preferred locales and preferred locales is a list of a list of languages that we can pass for this customer indicating their preferred languages we already have two elements for this array defined here as keys in the request so let's select both of these and we'll add two languages so that's spanish and english click send and if we look at the customer that's returned to us in the response we can see this array of preferred locales that's been set now what if we wanted to add a third um a third element to this list well we can do that by defining it ourselves so we'll copy uh the key name here come down to the end of the body paste it we'll need to update the index we can set it to french and now we have three items in this element let's look now at how we could pass um parameters that are passed as a hash of data and a good example of this might be the components that that make up an address so let's set the address on this customer now the postman interface uh is really nice for these types of parameters because often the keys will already be defined for you for these nested parameters and all you have to do is select the ones you want to set so let's set an address we'll set san francisco get a street address a zip code and lastly we'll set the state click send and we can see the address now returned to us in the customer another thing you might want to do is pass additional fields that aren't already listed as possible parameters you can add these fields manually just like we added an additional element to the preferred locales list so let's look at how we could do this by adding a custom field to the invoice settings on a customer now the invoice settings control information about how the invoice uh looks when a customer views it and one thing that we allow you to do is set custom fields there that the customer will see in their invoice so let's add a custom field for an account number when you add a custom field you need to set two values for that the custom fields element in invoice settings is an array and each element of the array contains a name in a name and value pair so in this case we would have a name of account number and then we'd have a value of the number itself so we're going to add those by coming down here and defining them and we'll add one field for the name this is our account number and then we'll add another field for the value itself and if we look at the invoice settings on this customer now we can see this custom fields array inside the invoice settings hash now custom fields is an array so we could add another custom field let's say we want to add a field for the customer's region so i'm going to just copy copy this one and the one thing we have to do here is if we if we are going to add more than one element to the array we need to define the indexes so we'll update this call to have the first place in the array and this one will be the second one add a value for the region and in the response you can see that we're updating this array here let's take a look at how we would update any of these fields now so we'll copy the customer id we'll go over to the update call and we're going to uh update this the first thing we're going to do is replace this colon customer placeholder with the id that we have you could also use an environment variable here for the path now when you're updating arrays and hashes those data types what you need to do is pass the result that you want to be in that array after the update so if we go back to our preferred locales example let's say we wanted to add a fourth language to that list we would need to pass first we would need to pass the other three languages that are already set on that customer so we'd set those first the key for the third value and then add a key for one more value and now we can see our array has four elements in it it's kind of unlikely that the customer would have four preferred languages so let's remove all but one of those to do that we would just pass one element and that's going to remove the other three so now the customer only has one one language set with uh hashes it's a similar concept so if we needed to update the city of the address to say santa clara we'd need to update all the other information as well and i can show you what will happen if you don't update it i won't select postal code here but i'll go ahead and select state and if we look at the address now you can see the whole value of the hash was updated and so we're missing postal code and we need to make another request to update that nested parameters that the example with the invoice settings and custom fields would work exactly the same way so if we wanted to remove the region we'd need to set uh we need to still pass the account number and so now our custom fields has just the account number as as the only element in it one common use case for setting additional fields is in supplying metadata and it's so common that we have a whole episode dedicated to how to work with metadata in requests you\", metadata={'source': 'EsOLI6h9XBY', 'title': 'Advanced requests with the Stripe

iso code for the country in which the user's bank is located you can gather this information from the user earlier in your flow we'll also pass along some billing details in this case the name that we collected in the form earlier the confirm so forth payment function will redirect the customer to the bank for authorization of the payment and return to our configured return url so let's try it out when we click pay will be redirected to the authorization page if i authorize the payment we're sent back to the return url by using the client secret together with the retrieve payment intent function from stripe gs we can report on the status of the payment the client secret and payment intent id are passed back to us as in the return url as query parameters let's add some simple code to

we can use the retrieve payment intent function from stripe.js to fetch the payment intent from the api we then log the payment intent status out to the messages div the status of the payment intent

you'll learn how to implement a react client to accept a one-time grab pay payment with a custom form so grab pay is a payment method developed by grab grabpay is a digital wallet customers maintain a balance in their wallets that they pay out with so in order to pay with grab pay customers are redirected to the grab pays website where they have to authenticate the transaction using a one-time password after authenticating customers will be redirected back to your site in this example we're going to assume that you already have a server set up for creating payment intents and you want to add support for confirming these grab pay payments on the client if you don't already have a server implemented you can head over to one of the integration examples that we have for one of the officially supported server languages those are linked down in the description also before we get too far if you're not using react we also have episodes about grab pay and accepting grad pay payments using vanilla js and html those are also going to be linked down in the description all right let's get started our server is up and running it has two endpoints we'll interact with today one is slash config for fetching publishable keys and one is slash create payment intent now this endpoint accepts a payment method type and a currency as arguments here we're going to pass grab pay as our payment method type and malaysian ringgits as our currency this endpoint is going to create a payment intent on the server and return just its client secret property which we'll use to confirm the payment on the client so let's take a look at what we already have this client directory is created with the create react app base we'll start off in index.js first we're fetching that publishable key using the config endpoint next we're calling load stripe passing in that publishable key load stripe is available in the stripe.js npm module and will load the stripe.js tag on every single page here we're using the elements provider passing in that stripe promise as our stripe prop this elements provider is wrapping the entire app so that we have access to both stripe elements and to stripe.js inside of child's components now let's head over and take a look at appjs so inside of app.js we are using react router dom to define some routes we'll create a brand new route grab pay where we'll render our grab pay payment form we're going to import grab pay from slash grab pay which doesn't exist yet and we'll have to head over and create grabpay.js where we'll implement our grab pay form we're going to export default with router so that if we need to we can redirect inside of this component we'll also need to import with router from react router dom and we'll need to import react start off with a basic form component that will have a pay button and we'll collect the name from the customer here in our name component we're going to use the standard use state state management so that we can two-way bind our name using the name value and set name next we're also going to import status messages which is a component that we can use to render some messages to the ui instead of needing to constantly open up the terminal status messages will loop over a list of strings and print those out to the console we also have this helpful use messages hook we can create a messages state variable and an add message helper function that we can call to add messages to that div now at this point our form is not handling submit so let's add a brand new submit handler where we're going to do two things first we're going to create a payment intent on the server and then we're going to confirm that payment on the client now to create the payment inside the server we're going to use the fetch api to send a post request to slash create payment intent this will return a promise that will resolve with either an error or the client secret for that newly created payment intent recall that this endpoint accepts two arguments we're going to pass the payment method type and the currency now in practice you would very likely hard code the payment method types you support on the server and the currencies that you support on the server here we're passing those in so that we can demonstrate the widest variety of payment method type and currency combinations now if something failed while we were creating that payment intent we'll log out that back-end error to our status messages div otherwise we'll log out that the payment intent was created next we need to call stripe dot confirm grab pay payment this is a method that's available on stripe.js and we can pass in as the first argument the client secret property for that payment intent that was just returned from the server we'll also pass in some billing details including the name of the customer and a return url this return url will be the url to which the customer is redirected after they complete their payment flow on the grab pay site notice our error is saying that stripe isn't loaded we need to use the used stripe hook from react stripe js and ensure that stripe is loaded when the form is submitted if stripe is not loaded we'll just log out a simple message to our messages div here and return early confirm grab pay payment will return a promise that promise might resolve with an error property and if there's an error we'll again log that status message out to our div all right let's take this for a spin so we click on pay and we're brought to the test payment page where we can then click on authorized test payment and we're redirected back to our fpx payment flow notice here in the query string that we have access to the id for the payment intent and the client secret property for the payment intent we can use the payment intent's client secret in combination with our publishable key to re-retrieve the payment intent on the client and display the status of the payment to the customer so now we'll implement a brand new component that will be sort of the thank you page or the return page for the grab pay payment we'll call this component grab pay return and this will be a very simple component with a header and the status messages div where we can add some messages about the payment intent that was created now the goal here is to refetch that payment intent with a client secret from those query string parameters we need to use the use effect hook because we're going to make an asynchronous call out to stripe to re-retrieve that payment intent we'll extract the query string parameters from the location search bar and we want specifically that payment intent client secret now we can call stripe.retrievepayment passing in the client secret property for that payment intent that'll return a promise that will resolve with an payment intent object that we can then use to add a brand new message to our status messages div before we get too far we need to also call use stripe so that we have access to that stripe object and we'll pass that in again as a dependency and make sure that it's loaded before we call retrieve payment now in order for us to use this component on the return page we need to create a higher order component called grab pay that will check to see if there is a return keyword in the query string parameters and if so it will render the return component otherwise it will render the form component now we'll return with router passing in this higher order component where now we can see our return flow when we get back to the return page so let's take this for a spin again we'll click on pay we're redirected to the test payment page where we can click on authorized test payment authorized test payment will bring us back to our return page we can now see the the status of the payment intent and its id and if we click on its id we're brought into the stripe dashboard where we can confirm that this payment was collected with grab pay and we see that the status is now succeeded and the amount for the payment and several other details all right so as a quick recap in index.js we loaded our publishable key and an instance of stripe we wrapped our entire app with this elements provider then we went over to app.js and added a new route for grab pay where we can render this grab pay component in our grab pay form component we added a new form where we collected the name for the customer and when we handle submit of that form we create a payment intent on the server by sending a post request to create payment intent passing in grab pay and malaysian ringgits then we confirm that payment intent by calling confirm grab pay payment passing in the payment intent client secret that was returned from the server in the previous step we also pass in some payment method details and a return url and when the customer finishes their payment on grabpay's site we're redirected back to this return url where we can then use the payment intents client secret to re-retrieve the payment intent and display its status to the customer again our higher level grab pay component is checking to see if it has that return keyword in the url and if so it renders the return component otherwise it renders the form component at this point you are fully equipped to head out and build a react-based payment form to collect a one-time grab pay payment

learn how to implement an html and javascript client to accept a one-time bax direct debit payment with a custom form stripe users in australia can accept beck's debit payments from customers with an australian bank account today you'll learn how to generate this mandate and to how to present it to your customers beck's direct debit is a reusable delayed notification payment method this means that it can take up to four business days to receive notification on the success or failure of a payment after you initiate the debit from your customer's account so in this example we're going to assume that you already have a server set up for creating payment intents and you want to add support for confirming these direct debit payments on the front end if you don't already have a server implemented take a look at one of our example integrations in our officially supported server languages those are going to be linked down in the description also before we get too far if you're using react we have videos for accepting beck's direct debit payments with that client implementation also linked down in the description all right let's get started so our server is up and running it has two endpoints that we're going to interact with today one is slash config for fetching publishable keys and one is slash create payment intent which takes in a payment method type and a currency sort of as arguments so here we're going to pass in aubex debit as the payment method type and aud or australian dollars as the currency this endpoint is going to create a payment intent object and return just its client secret property which we're going to use to confirm the payment on the client all right let's take a look at what we've already got set up here so in this demo app we have an index.html page that links out to bex debit.html and that page right now consists of a header tag and a div for adding some messages the first thing we want to do is add a couple script tags to load some javascript so we want to load stripe.js from js.stripe.com this is a best practice to load this on every single page we also want to load utils.js which is a helper function for adding messages and finally a javascript file for our bex debit javascript that we'll implement in a bit next we need to add some html for our payment form where we'll collect the name and email address of the customer now if we refresh the page we can see those two controls for the name and email inputs the first thing we're going to do is add a new label for the bank account now this bank account label is going to have a for attribute that has the same id as a div that we're going to use as the container for that bank account element note that when we refresh the page we can see the label but we don't see any bank account element being populated yet because we need to use stripe.js to populate that bank account element next we also need to add a div where we're going to add some copy this is the mandate acceptance text that's required when collecting aubex debit payments now the important thing here is that you go through and update this strong tag or the section here that says insert your business name here that should be your your company's name your business's name so that the mandate text is applicable to your business let's head over and implement bexdebit.js so once the dom is fully loaded we're first going to create an instance of the stripe object passing in our publishable key next we want to create reference to some stripe elements so we're going to use stripe.elements to create an elements object and then we're going to create an au bank account element we're going to pass in the au bank account string here which will create an au bank account element and we want to mount it to that div that we created earlier with the same id so notice that this div has a eubank account element we're using the css selector for that div so that we can mount the element into the div now when the form is submitted we want to do two things first we want to create a payment intent on the server and second we want to confirm that payment intent on the client so we're going to use the fetch api here to send a post request to slash create payment intent and again that's going to expect two arguments the payment method type and we're going to pass a u-bax debit it'll also expect the currency so again we're going to pass in australian dollars this endpoint will either resolve with an error property or with a client secret for that payment intent now if there was an error we'll use our add message method that comes from the utils helper and we'll just print out the error otherwise we'll add a little message saying that the payment intent was created next up we want to call stripe.confirmaubexdebitpayment this is going to accept a few different arguments the first is that client secret property for the payment intent that we just created and the second is going to be a big options block where we can pass in any of the billing details that we we collected earlier namely this aubex debit bank account element reference and we'll pass also the name and email so let's grab reference to that name and email by id and we'll pass in the values for the name and email that were entered by the customer now confirm aubex debit is going to return a promise that will resolve with either an error or a payment intent object and if there was an error again we will log out a message to our status messages div otherwise we will add a message showing the id and status for the payment intent all right let's take this for a whirl so we're going to refresh the page and you'll notice that this bsb and account number controls are waiting for us to enter in some account details in test mode we can enter all zeros for the bsb and there are several different test account numbers that are available in the stripe documentation next we're going to hit pay and we can see that the payment intent was created and we see the id of the payment intent here we can actually click on that link it'll bring us into the stripe dashboard where we can inspect and look at this payment that was just collected and we can see indeed it was beck's direct debit as the payment method type and it was collected for 19.99 australian dollars let's run another test here where we pass again all zeros for our bsb and then all ones with one three at the very end as another test account number this test account number will fail the payment so you can test a bunch of different scenarios as you're building out your payment flow to ensure that you're handling both the success and failure cases for these payments all right so as a quick recap from our index.html page we have a link to beck's direct debit where we first installed three javascript files and then we went down and implemented a payment form where we were collecting the name and email address and uh then we added a an au bank account element container where we use stripe.js elements to mount those bank account controls we also added this mandate acceptance div so that we were presenting the correct legal copy then we headed over to bexdebit.js where we initialized an instance of stripe set up some stripe elements and then listened for the submission of the form and handled that by first sending a post request to create payment intent with our aubex debit payment method type and australian dollars as the currency finally we called confirm au bex debit passing in the client secret that we got back from the server and payment method type referring back that au bank account element and added just a bit of logging there at the end at this point you're fully equipped to head out and build a front end to accept aubex direct debit on the front end using html and javascript if you're curious about other payment method types we have links to tons of other videos available on the stripe developer's youtube channel thank you so much for watching and we'll see in the next one you\", metadata={'source': 'IeGpu9JNvNU', 'title': 'Accept AU Becs Debit payments with Stripe.js', 'description':

Document(page_content=\"wechat is a leading lifestyle super app used for messaging between people as well as connecting people services and businesses in china and around the world through a number of e-commerce and social features inside the app wechat pay the payment wallet inside the wechat app has over 800 million users chinese consumers can use wechat pay to pay for goods and services inside of businesses apps and websites now let's have a look how we can implement wechat pay in our website so here i just have a simple form just with a simple pay button let's have a look at the html for this so here we're just having our html5 document we're loading our css and our stripe.js that's very important stripe.js version 3. we have some utility helpers to add some messages to render them and then we have our wechat page as that we're going to tell you in a second we just have our headline and then our payment form just with a submit button to pay and then a little diff to show our alert messages on our page so jumping in here the first thing once our dom is loaded we want to fetch our publishable key from the stripe server so we have our server running in the background and from the config root we're fetching the publishable key and then here we're initializing stripe.js with some base headers so at the time of recording these beta headers are required but by the time that you're watching this you will only need to pass the publisher publishable key not any of the headers great and so now when the form is submitted um we first of all prevent the default submit action and then what we want to do is make a call to our server to create a new payment intent and then get the client secret for that payment intent so we can simply do a fetch call here to our back end so we say await fetch and we have our route is create payment intent and then we'll need to pass a couple of options so first of all we need to path our method so this is um a post request here and then we want to make this request as um json so we need to pass in content type and our content type is application json and then we also need to put some body so for the body we're um just string flying a json here and specifically we are passing uh our currency so uh for wechat we're just going to use uh chinese again here and then also we need to pass the payment method type to our server which then creates the correct payment intent for us and we'll just say wechat pay so that's our payment method type and then lastly we'll need to get our response and then cast that into great so now we get our um json response back and so we can now deconstruct our response so first of all i will say here if we get an error in our response that's a backend error and otherwise we get a client secret and so now what we can do is um we can check if we have a back-end error in that case we show um we have a method here called at message so that's part of our utilities and then we can say backend error and just get the message there to render that out and if we have an error we just abort and return at this point uh but if we don't have an error we can then uh go ahead and we can confirm the payment with the client secret that we just gotten from our server uh using stripe.js and so the way this works is we are again this is an asynchronous action so on uh stripe our stripe.js we can call confirm we chat pay payment so that is fairly self-explanatory uh the wechat pay payment we pass in our client secret and then we'll just need to pass in some payment method options so payment method options and uh here specifically we're saying okay we're passing in some options for wechat pay and then what we're passing in is that we're on the web client so what this tells stripe.js is that we want to render a qr code so by default stripe.js renders our qr code in an iframe and then the user can just scan that and again here we might get an error back and let's just call that stripe error and then otherwise we get a payment intent and so what we can do now is basically just again check if we have a stripe error then we again add a message to say um stripe error dot message and we abort but if we don't have a stripe arrow we just add a message to say um let's say payment and we'll just write out the payment intent dot status and then let's also render out the payment intent id great and so that's already it we can now go ahead and test this out so let's go over let's hit pay and so now we're calling confirm payment intent and what we can do now so we are in test mode we can scan um this qr code with our um phone and it just goes to a stripe test page and then there we just authorize the test payment and what happens in the background is that we check this and then our confirm wechat pay payment method resolves with the payment intent and we now see the payment is succeeded great so that's how easily you can accept wechat pay payments from your customers in china on your website using stripe.js and html thanks for tuning in and see you next time\", metadata={'source': 'm5gfiLCpJyc', 'title': 'Accept a WeChat Pay payment with Stripe.js',

Document(page_content=\"we can add the stripe react native sdk to our react native and expo projects using either yarn or npm i'm going to show you how to do this using a new export project so i started with a blank typescript expo app and i've added a little navigation container here um using react navigation i'm just a stack navigator and i have one home screen here and one card screen in the home screen i um just have this little list view a kind of scroll view with some list items and kind of a collapse component here so i can nest different things underneath and then i have one list item called card and so when i tap on that we navigate to our card view so this is where we're going to implement the um card field in a separate video later on but for now let's go ahead and add stripe to our project so as i mentioned we can add yarn here and we're just going to add this to our project and so now we can see that stripe react native version 0 1 4 was added to our project and so now in our root view we can wrap our app into the stripe provider so that is needed to initialize a stripe now we can do this in two different ways actually so we can use the stripe provider as mentioned here and we can wrap our app or our payment screen into the stripe provider or alternatively we can use um the init stripe method in a use effect for example so when our app is loaded we then init stripe so in our case here we're just going to go with the stripe provider approach so we can import the stripe provider from stripe react native so let's do that here so stripe react native is our namespace with the add stripe and then we can import the stripe provider now we can wrap our um root of the app so our app.tcx into the stripe provider and the sprite provider requires um a publishable key to be set so here we need to provide the publishable key and so the publishable key we will need to load in our application here we can load it from the server and that's generally recommended to load the key rather than hard coding it and then we can easily also switch the keys should we need to by just changing them on our server and don't need to submit kind of a new app code so let's use a state variable here publishable key and set publishable key and we're going to say use state and so in the beginning that is just an empty string and then set publishable key so we will need to fetch uh our publishable key from the server so first of all um there are some differences in kind of loading from localhost so here in our app we just have our server so we have we're running the node server and we just have that running on localhostport4242 and so let's actually go ahead and create a new file let's call it config.ts and here we're just going to specify kind of our api url and that is different depending on what platform we're running from so let's import platform from react native and then we can say so we want to export export a const and we're just going to call it api url um and so we're saying if the platform os so if the platform os equals android then we need a specific ip address here so android is proxying localhost to 10.0.2.2 and then onport4242 and otherwise if we're on ios we can just use a good old localhost so um just 127.1 and then also on port 4242 so here we are our api url if we're running on android we get the android specific proxy and otherwise we get the localhost great and now let's actually do um another file and we're just going to call it uh helper albus.ts and so we're just going to implement a little fetch publishable key helper method here so first of all we'll import our api url from our config and then we're going to export a new function and that's an async function that is going to fetch and we're just calling it fetch publishable key and then we're just going to try catch in here so we're going to try to fetch from our api url and we have a route called config that returns our um publishable key and then we're going to destructure the publishable key from our response which comes back as json and then if that is successful we're just returning the publishable key and then we'll need to catch if we have an error uh and we can just console.log the error maybe and then we can also maybe add a little console warn and just say unable to fetch publishable key is your server running that happens to me a lot that i forget to run the server and then maybe we can also add a little alert uh and we'll need to import that alert from react native and then we can say alert.alert and maybe let's just say error and then again let's just take this so then we have our little helper method here to fetch our publishable key and so now we can use that in our app when our app loads we then want to load the publishable key so to do that we can use the use effect of react and since this is an async operation we'll need to first define kind of an async function let's just call it init and then in there just say const publishable key equals await fetch publishable key which we will also need to import from our helpers we'll just check if we have a publishable key and if we have it then we set the publishable key to our key and then we can feed it into our stripe provider great and that's everything we need to load our stripe provider let's make sure we're also closing it down here fabulous so now lastly let's run up our expo app let's just start it here in ios and now we got our um expo devtools here but one thing that you can see is that we're seeing some dependencies are incompatible with the installed expo package version so expo does actually some magic thing under the hood so it bundles the stripe react native sdk with the expo client um but the xbox line is only updated every so often so there might be a version mismatch and for things to work correctly we need to get the exact version that is being used with the current expo sdk that we're using so let's go ahead and actually change this so in our package json we find our entry for strike rack native so currently that's at two zero one four now let's set this to exactly zero one one and so now when we start again the warning should be gone no of course we first need to actually update things so let's run yarn and so now we should see this reflected and so now if we run yarn ios the warning should be gone and we are ready to go and our project is opening it's still working great and so now we're ready to implement the codfield component and actually accept credit cards thanks for tuning in and see you in

implement a react client to accept a one-time after pay clear pay payment with a custom form after pay is also known as clear pay in the uk and it's a payment method for customers to buy now and pay later so after pay provides your customers in australia canada new zealand the uk and the us a way to split their purchases over several installments so the customer only pays the first installment at purchase time and you are immediately paid in full and afterpay collects the remaining installments from your customer over time so after pay is particularly popular among businesses that are selling things like fashion beauty and sports products and in this example we're going to assume that we already have a server set up for creating payment intents and we want to add support for creating these after pay clear pay payments on the front end if you don't already have a server implemented that's all right you can head over and take a look at one of our example integrations in one of the officially supported server languages those are linked down in the description also before we get too far if you're using vanilla.js or some other implementation for your client that is not react we have episodes for accepting clearpay and after pay payments with other client implementations those are also linked down in the description our server is already up and running it has two endpoints that we're gonna interact with today one is slash config for fetching publishable keys and one is create payment intent and create payment intent takes in the payment method type and the currency so here we're going to pass in after pay clearpay as the payment method type and we're going to pass usd for our currency today now this endpoint is going to create a payment intent on the server and return just its client secret property which we'll use to confirm that payment on the client all right let's take a look at what we already have this is an app based on create react app the create react app template and in index.js the first thing we do is load our publishable key and create a stripe promise with load stripe this is a helper that comes from the npm module for stripe.js then we're going to use the elements provider and wrap our entire application and pass in just one prop that's going to be the stripe prop which is either an instance of the stripe object or a promise that will resolve to a stripe object and we want to use this elements provider and wrap the entire app so that we have access to both the stripe object and all of the react stripe.js elements components inside of the application let's head over and take a look at app.js next so appjs right now is using react router dom to create some routes we're going to add a brand new route for after pay clear pay and initially we will just render the the after pay clear pay component that is yet to be created so we're going to import that and when we import it you'll notice that we get an error because we're going to fail to compile uh because this isn't actually this doesn't exist yet so we're going to go implement a functional react component for collecting these after pay clear pay payments so in after pay clearpay.js we're going to export default with router the after pay clearpay form component initially we're going to use with router so that we can redirect from this component if we need to so the after pay clearpay form component is not going to take in any props initially and to start out we'll just return an empty string just so we can get get this thing set up we're going to import with router from react router dom and we also need to import react so that we can use jsx inside of this component all right so let's set up a basic after pay clear pay component here we'll create a head tag with the title of the payment method type and then we're going to add a form now this form is where we'll collect all of the billing details for after pay clear pay and in order to accept and after pay clear pay payment we need to collect both the billing information the billing address and shipping address and so i've organized these into separate field sets just so that we can keep them logically organized now for the billing we need to collect the name the email and then the full address so address line one line two city state a postal code and a country and so we're gonna sort of quickly scaffold out all of these different controls you'll notice that with each of these controls we're passing in a value prop and an on change prop these are going to use the use state hook in order to keep keep track of the state and sort of bind our controls in two different directions here all right now that we've got all of our form control set up we're going to import use state from react and then we'll go through creating all of our state variables and passing in some sensible defaults so that we don't have to type into the form every single time that we're trying to test this so we're going to pull out the uh and set up the name email line one two and city state zip and postal code are the the postal code and country for the billing address and we'll do the same for the shipping address all right now we can see in the browser all of our form controls are rendering for our after pay clear pay form that's looking fantastic you'll notice though that if we refresh the browser and hit pay nothing actually happens that's because we haven't wired up the submission of the form to do anything with our javascript so we're going to add an on submit handler called handle submit this is going to be an async function and we will prevent defaults that we don't cause a full page reload and when the form is submitted we want to do two things first we're going to create the payment intent on the server and second we're going to confirm that payment intent here on the client now in order to create the payment intent on the server we're going to use the fetch api that's built into the browser to send a post request to create payment intent this will return a promise that will resolve with either an error property or a client secret we're going to alias the error to back end error so we can deconflict with another error that we're going to use here shortly recall that this endpoint expects two arguments the payment method type in the currency again we're passing after pay clear pay and usd in practice you could hard code the payment method type in currency on the server you don't have to pass these in from the client the reason that we're doing this is so that we can demonstrate the widest variety of payment method type and currency combinations while still maintaining sort of the same sort of back end next we see that there is an error that says that add message is not defined so add message is a helper that comes from the status messages component so we're going to import status messages and the use messages hook from our status messages javascript file that's here we can take a quick look at it it is a small component that iterates over a list of string messages and then prints out a list of divs so we'll use the use messages hook in order to create a list of messages and an add message helper function that will add a string message to that list so messages is a list of strings an add message expects a string message and we'll add that to the list of messengers there is a method exposed from stripe called confirm after pay payment this takes in a couple of different arguments the very first one is the client secret property that was just returned from the server and the second is a big options block where we're going to pass in all the payment method details that we just collected from the client now in order to use this method from stripe.js we need to use the use stripe hook to grab reference to that stripe object that was passed down from the elements provider from index.js now if stripe is not loaded yet when the form is submitted then we're going to just add a log message that says stripe hasn't loaded yet otherwise we'll continue on with the rest of the form submission so for this confirm after pay clear pay payment we're going to start passing down all the the state variables that we've collected above and a return url so the return url is the url to which a customer will be redirected after they've gone through the payment flow in the after pay ui so they're going to be when they click pay they'll be redirected to after pay and then when they're done sort of filling out any after pay information they'll be redirected back to this return url now confirm after pay payment returns a promise that will resolve with either an error or a payment intent property all right let's take this for a spin so if we refresh the browser and hit pay then we're redirected to this after pay clear pay test payment page where we can decide to authorize the test payment or click fail test payment which will simulate the failure of a payment so let's click on authorized test payment and notice that we are redirected right back to this after pay clearpay path however in the query string we see return true so this is something that we added to our return url and now when we are returned to this route rather than just re-rendering the same component we want to refactor this a little bit so that we can render a separate component for to show the status of the payment and just to sort of thank the customer for for their payment so let's create a couple new components here we'll create the after pay clearpay component which will be sort of apparent for both the form and the return and this is where we will fork on that query string parameter so if there was return that return query string parameter then we will render the return component otherwise we will render our form component so we're going to grab reference to the query string using the use location hook we're going to say if the query string has the return key then we're going to return the after pay clearpay return component otherwise we'll return the after particular pay form component all right so for our after pay re clear pay return component this will be where we will retrieve the payment intent and display its status we are also going to import use location from react router dom so the after paid clearpay return component will again add an h1 saying this was an afterpay clearpay payment we'll add another thank you message and then again we're going to use the status messages component inside of the after pay clear pay return so that we can show the any messages that we uh would like without needing to import from the console looks like we actually forgot to add the status messages component to our form so let's do that too and then we're going to use again we're going to use the use messages hook to create a messages state variable and we're going to grab reference to stripe again and pull out the client secret from the query string parameters so if we look at the query string parameters you'll notice that one of the keys is payment intent client secret and that will have the client secret property for the payment intent in order to retrieve that payment intent from the stripe api using stripe.js we need to call stripe dot retrieve payment intent and pass in the client secret property retrieve payment intent returns a promise that will resolve with either an error property or the payment intent object if there was an error we'll log out that error to the status messages div otherwise we'll print out the payments id and its status now you'll notice that the compilation error we're seeing on the right hand side says that we we are not allowed to use a weight unless we're inside of an async function and so in order to get around this we're going to create just a little wrapper function called fetch payment intent while we're inside of this use effect hook we also need to check to make sure that stripe is loaded otherwise we'll return early okay now we can refresh the page and we see the id of the payment intent that test payment intent that we just created and in fact we can click on that that'll bring us to the stripe dashboard to show us the payment intent in the dashboard and we see that the payment intent had succeeded so this is all looking great let's go through the payment flow one last time so we'll refresh the page and click on pay we'll again authorize the test payment we're brought back to our return url where we now see the status of the payment intent and its id we can click on that payment intent id and drill into the stripe dashboard where again we see this payment for 19.99 in us dollars has succeeded all right so just as a super quick recap let's take a look back at index.js this is where the publishable key is being fetched and we're setting up the elements provider which wraps the entire application passing stripe down in app.js we imported after pay clearpay this new component that we just built and we added a new route that matches on after payclearpay to render that component then we built out this big afterpay clearpay form to collect the billing details the shipping details we added a form submission handler that said when the form is submitted we're going to create the payment intent on the server and we're going to pass the the payment method type in the currency we're going to use the client secret return from that call in order to confirm the payment on the client and we called confirm after pay clear pay payment passed in all those details that we collected from the client in order to confirm that payment when the payment was confirmed we were redirected to the after pay clear pay test page where we went through some payment flow and then we were redirected back to this return url which again had that return query string parameter allowing us to sort of switch on whether we're going to return this after pay clear pay return component or the form component and again in the after pay clearpay return component we pulled the payment intent client secret out of the query string parameter and used that to retrieve the payment intent with stripe.js when we called fetch payment intent all right so at this point you are fully equipped to go out and implement an after pay clearpay payment method in your react applications thank you so much for watching thanks for your time and attention and we'll see you in the next one\", metadata={'source': 'GS91DCwn_Ek', 'title': 'Accept an Afterpay

'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"in this video we're going to look at how to make requests using the stripe api postman collection this is actually the second video of a two-part video series and so if you haven't watched the introductory video yet i encourage you to start with that video in this video we're going to look at how to pass arrays or lists of data how to pass nested parameters and we'll also take a look at how to pass additional parameters that you don't see listed by default in the body of the request to get started i've already gone ahead and forked the collection from the stripe public workspace into my own personal workspace and i've set my api key as an environment variable if you haven't done these two things yet check out our installation and authentication episodes so let's get started by passing a list of data in a request and we're going to use the create a customer call as our example request so we'll go into the collection and click on create a customer and when we look through the parameters that are available to us in this request we can see this one parameter called preferred locales and preferred locales is a list of a list of languages that we can pass for this customer indicating their preferred languages we already have two elements for this array defined here as keys in the request so let's select both of these and we'll add two languages so that's spanish and english click send and if we look at the customer that's returned to us in the response we can see this array of preferred locales that's been set now what if we wanted to add a third um a third element to this list well we can do that by defining it ourselves so we'll copy uh the key name here come down to the end of the body paste it we'll need to update the index we can set it to french and now we have three items in this element let's look now at how we could pass um parameters that are passed as a hash of data and a good example of this might be the components that that make up an address so let's set the address on this customer now the postman interface uh is really nice for these types of parameters because often the keys will already be defined for you for these nested parameters and all you have to do is select the ones you want to set so let's set an address we'll set san francisco get a street address a zip code and lastly we'll set the state click send and we can see the address now returned to us in the customer another thing you might want to do is pass additional fields that aren't already listed as possible parameters you can add these fields manually just like we added an additional element to the preferred locales list so let's look at how we could do this by adding a custom field to the invoice settings on a customer now the invoice settings control information about how the invoice uh looks when a customer views it and one thing that we allow you to do is set custom fields there that the customer will see in their invoice so let's add a custom field for an account number when you add a custom field you need to set two values for that the custom fields element in invoice settings is an array and each element of the array contains a name in a name and value pair so in this case we would have a name of account number and then we'd have a value of the number itself so we're going to add those by coming down here and defining them and we'll add one field for the name this is our account number and then we'll add another field for the value itself and if we look at the invoice settings on this customer now we can see this custom fields array inside the invoice settings hash now custom fields is an array so we could add another custom field let's say we want to add a field for the customer's region so i'm going to just copy copy this one and the one thing we have to do here is if we if we are going to add more than one element to the array we need to define the indexes so we'll update this call to have the first place in the array and this one will be the second one add a value for the region and in the response you can see that we're updating this array here let's take a look at how we would update any of these fields now so we'll copy the customer id we'll go over to the update call and we're going to uh update this the first thing we're going to do is replace this colon customer placeholder with the id that we have you could also use an environment variable here for the path now when you're updating arrays and hashes those data types what you need to do is pass the result that you want to be in that array after the update so if we go back to our preferred locales example let's say we wanted to add a fourth language to that list we would need to pass first we would need to pass the other three languages that are already set on that customer so we'd set those first the key for the third value and then add a key for one more value and now we can see our array has four elements in it it's kind of unlikely that the customer would have four preferred languages so let's remove all but one of those to do that we would just pass one element and that's going to remove the other three so now the customer only has one one language set with uh hashes it's a similar concept so if we needed to update the city of the address to say santa clara we'd need to update all the other information as well and i can show you what will happen if you don't update it i won't select postal code here but i'll go ahead and select state and if we look at the address now you can see the whole value of the hash was updated and so we're missing postal code and we need to make another request to update that nested parameters that the example with the invoice settings and custom fields would work exactly the same way so if we wanted to remove the region we'd need to set uh we need to still pass the account number and so now our custom fields has just the account number as as the only element in it one common use case for setting additional fields is in supplying metadata and it's so common that we have a whole episode dedicated to how to work with metadata in requests you\", metadata={'source': 'EsOLI6h9XBY', 'title': 'Advanced requests with the Stripe Postman collection', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 1145, 'thumbnail_url':

implement the front-end using html and javascript to accept a one-time payment using so fort support is a single-use delayed notification bank redirection payment method which means it can typically take 2 to 14 days to receive notification of a payment outcome let's say you already have a backend set up to create payments intents and you'd like to add support for accepting so fort payments on the front end if you haven't already implemented a backend head over and take a look at one of the server implementations in one of our officially supported server side languages our backend is up and running and has two endpoints that we'll interact with today one is config for fetching publishable keys and one is a post request to create payment intents this endpoint will take two arguments payment method type and currency the endpoint returns a client secret for a payment intent which you can use to confirm a payment on the front end let's start an index.html and get to work before we write any javascript the page needs a form where a customer can enter some billing details such as their name let's pre-populate the name so we don't have to fill it out every time we test and we'll add a submit button to send the form when we click pay we'll also add a simple div below the form so that we can see some logging information without needing to open the console we're almost ready to jump into some javascript but first let's install stripe.js stripe.js should always be loaded directly from js.stripe.com and it's best practice to load it on every page next we'll add a reference to so4js to handle the form submission and payment confirmation if we reload the browser we should see our name field and pay button jumping into support.js let's do some setup i'm dropping in this little helper function for logging to the messages div this is purely for demonstration we grab a reference to the div then set it to display and add some inner html with the string of the message we also console lock the message so we have a chance to see it in multiple places so finally it's time for the main part of the demo we start with a wrapper so that our code only runs when the dom is fully loaded then we initialize stripe the stripe constructor function comes from stripe.js which we installed earlier and it expects a publishable key as the first argument you can find your api keys in the stripe dashboard when the form is submitted we prevent the default actions so that the browser doesn't reload next we make an ajax call to the server to create the payment intent and store the result there are several libraries and packages that help with making ajax requests you might be using jquery axios or something similar but in this case we're using the browser's native fetch api to avoid any extra dependencies here we'll specify the payment method type and currency in this demo we're showing how to accept payments using so fort but in other videos in this series you'll see how to accept other payment method types like alipay separate direct debit ideal and more it's also worth mentioning that you could technically hard code a list of supported payment method types in the back end but our server expects that we pass the payment method type and currency so that we can demonstrate the widest variety of payment method types we'll also add some logging now that we have the client secret we'll confirm the payment using the confirm so for payment function we pass the iso code for the country in which the user's bank is located you can gather this information from the user earlier in your flow we'll also pass along some billing details in this case the name that we collected in the form earlier the confirm so forth payment function will redirect the customer to the bank for authorization of the payment and return to our configured return url so let's try it out when we click pay will be redirected to the authorization page if i authorize the payment we're sent back to the return url by using the client secret together with the retrieve payment intent function from stripe gs we can report on the status of the payment the client secret and payment intent id are passed back to us as in the return url as query parameters let's add some simple code to log the payment outcome after redirection back to the return url we'll grab the url from the window location and then the query params if the client secret is in the url we'll save it for later then we can use the retrieve payment intent function from stripe.js to fetch the payment intent from the api we then log the payment intent status out to the messages div the status of the payment intent is processing as we mentioned earlier it can take a number of days for so forth payment to process if we jump into the dashboard we can see the pending test payment one last bit of cleanup let's load the publishable key from the server with an ajax call and use that to initialize stripe we'll pass the constant to the constructor let's quickly retest and confirm that things are working as before in review we first created an html form to submit a payment next we initialize stripe and added a form handler to create a payment intent where we pass the currency and payment method type to the server finally we confirmed that payments intent client-side with stripe.js using the client secret from the payment intent so now you're fully equipped to build a custom payment flow to accept a one-time support payment with stripe watch other videos in this playlist to see how to accept different types of payment methods as always if you have any feedback please let us know by completing the feedback form linked in the description thanks and see you next time [Music] you\", metadata={'source':

custom form so grab pay is a payment method developed by grab grabpay is a digital wallet customers maintain a balance in their wallets that they pay out with so in order to pay with grab pay customers are redirected to the grab pays website where they have to authenticate the transaction using a one-time password after authenticating customers will be redirected back to your site in this example we're going to assume that you already have a server set up for creating payment intents and you want to add support for confirming these grab pay payments on the client if you don't already have a server implemented you can head over to one of the integration examples that we have for one of the officially supported server languages those are linked down in the description also before we get too far if you're not using react we also have episodes about grab pay and accepting grad pay payments using vanilla js and html those are also going to be linked down in the description all right let's get started our server is up and running it has two endpoints we'll interact with today one is slash config for fetching publishable keys and one is slash create payment intent now this endpoint accepts a payment method type and a currency as arguments here we're going to pass grab pay as our payment method type and malaysian ringgits as our currency this endpoint is going to create a payment intent on the server and return just its client secret property which we'll use to confirm the payment on the client so let's take a look at what we already have this client directory is created with the create react app base we'll start off in index.js first we're fetching that publishable key using the config endpoint next we're calling load stripe passing in that publishable key load stripe is available in the stripe.js npm module and will load the stripe.js tag on every single page here we're using the elements provider passing in that stripe promise as our stripe prop this elements provider is wrapping the entire app so that we have access to both stripe elements and to stripe.js inside of child's components now let's head over and take a look at appjs so inside of app.js we are using react router dom to define some routes we'll create a brand new route grab pay where we'll render our grab pay payment form we're going to import grab pay from slash grab pay which doesn't exist yet and we'll have to head over and create grabpay.js where we'll implement our grab pay form we're going to export default with router so that if we need to we can redirect inside of this component we'll also need to import with router from react router dom and we'll need to import react start off with a basic form component that will have a pay button and we'll collect the name from the customer here in our name component we're going to use the standard use state state management so that we can two-way bind our name using the name value and set name next we're also going to import status messages which is a component that we can use to render some messages to the ui instead of needing to constantly open up the terminal status messages will loop over a list of strings and print those out to the console we also have this helpful use messages hook we can create a messages state variable and an add message helper function that we can call to add messages to that div now at this point our form is not handling submit so let's add a brand new submit handler where we're going to do two things first we're going to create a payment intent on the server and then we're going to confirm that payment on the client now to create the payment inside the server we're going to use the fetch api to send a post request to slash create payment intent this will return a promise that will resolve with either an error or the client secret for that newly created payment intent recall that this endpoint accepts two arguments we're going to pass the payment method type and the currency now in practice you would very likely hard code the payment method types you support on the server and the currencies that you support on the server here we're passing those in so that we can demonstrate the widest variety of payment method type and currency combinations now if something failed while we were creating that payment intent we'll log out that back-end error to our status messages div otherwise we'll log out that the payment intent was created next we need to call stripe dot confirm grab pay payment this is a method that's available on stripe.js and we can pass in as the first argument the client secret property for that payment intent that was just returned from the server we'll also pass in some billing details including the name of the customer and a return url this return url will be the url to which the customer is redirected after they complete their payment flow on the grab pay site notice our error is saying that stripe isn't loaded we need to use the used stripe hook from react stripe js and ensure that stripe is loaded when the form is submitted if stripe is not loaded we'll just log out a simple message to our messages div here and return early confirm grab pay payment will return a promise that promise might resolve with an error property and if there's an error we'll again log that status message out to our div all right let's take this for a spin so we click on pay and we're brought to the test payment page where we can then click on authorized test payment and we're redirected back to our fpx payment flow notice here in the query string that we have access to the id for the payment intent and the client secret property for the payment intent we can use the payment intent's client secret in combination with our publishable key to re-retrieve the payment intent on the client and display the status of the payment to the customer so now we'll implement a brand new component that will be sort of the thank you page or the return page for the grab pay payment we'll call this component grab pay return and this will be a very simple component with a header and the status messages div where we can add some messages about the payment intent that was created now the goal here is to refetch that payment intent with a client secret from those query string parameters we need to use the use effect hook because we're going to make an asynchronous call out to stripe to re-retrieve that payment intent we'll extract the query string parameters from the location search bar and we want specifically that payment intent client secret now we can call stripe.retrievepayment passing in the client secret property for that payment intent that'll return a promise that will resolve with an payment intent object that we can then use to add a brand new message to our status messages div before we get too far we need to also call use stripe so that we have access to that stripe object and we'll pass that in again as a dependency and make sure that it's loaded before we call retrieve payment now in order for us to use this component on the return page we need to create a higher order component called grab pay that will check to see if there is a return keyword in the query string parameters and if so it will render the return component otherwise it will render the form component now we'll return with router passing in this higher order component where now we can see our return flow when we get back to the return page so let's take this for a spin again we'll click on pay we're redirected to the test payment page where we can click on authorized test payment authorized test payment will bring us back to our return page we can now see the the status of the payment intent and its id and if we click on its id we're brought into the stripe dashboard where we can confirm that this payment was collected with grab pay and we see that the status is now succeeded and the amount for the payment and several other details all right so as a quick recap in index.js we loaded our publishable key and an instance of stripe we wrapped our entire app with this elements provider then we went over to app.js and added a new route for grab pay where we can render this grab pay component in our grab pay form component we added a new form where we collected the name for the customer and when we handle submit of that form we create a payment intent on the server by sending a post request to create payment intent passing in grab pay and malaysian ringgits then we confirm that payment intent by calling confirm grab pay payment passing in the payment intent client secret that was returned from the server in the previous step we also pass in some payment method details and a return url and when the customer finishes their payment on grabpay's site we're redirected back to this return url where we can then use the payment intents client secret to re-retrieve the payment intent and display its status to the customer again our higher level grab pay component is checking to see if it has that return keyword in the url and if so it renders the return component otherwise it renders the form component at this point you are fully equipped to head out and build a react-based payment form to collect a one-time grab pay payment thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one\", metadata={'source': 'p35U_dAoJ7E', 'title': 'Accept a GrabPay payment with React', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 706, 'thumbnail_url':

implement an html and javascript client to accept a one-time bax direct debit payment with a custom form stripe users in australia can accept beck's debit payments from customers with an australian bank account today you'll learn how to generate this mandate and to how to present it to your customers beck's direct debit is a reusable delayed notification payment method this means that it can take up to four business days to receive notification on the success or failure of a payment after you initiate the debit from your customer's account so in this example we're going to assume that you already have a server set up for creating payment intents and you want to add support for confirming these direct debit payments on the front end if you don't already have a server implemented take a look at one of our example integrations in our officially supported server languages those are going to be linked down in the description also before we get too far if you're using react we have videos for accepting beck's direct debit payments with that client implementation also linked down in the description all right let's get started so our server is up and running it has two endpoints that we're going to interact with today one is slash config for fetching publishable keys and one is slash create payment intent which takes in a payment method type and a currency sort of as arguments so here we're going to pass in aubex debit as the payment method type and aud or australian dollars as the currency this endpoint is going to create a payment intent object and return just its client secret property which we're going to use to confirm the payment on the client all right let's take a look at what we've already got set up here so in this demo app we have an index.html page that links out to bex debit.html and that page right now consists of a header tag and a div for adding some messages the first thing we want to do is add a couple script tags to load some javascript so we want to load stripe.js from js.stripe.com this is a best practice to load this on every single page we also want to load utils.js which is a helper function for adding messages and finally a javascript file for our bex debit javascript that we'll implement in a bit next we need to add some html for our payment form where we'll collect the name and email address of the customer now if we refresh the page we can see those two controls for the name and email inputs the first thing we're going to do is add a new label for the bank account now this bank account label is going to have a for attribute that has the same id as a div that we're going to use as the container for that bank account element note that when we refresh the page we can see the label but we don't see any bank account element being populated yet because we need to use stripe.js to populate that bank account element next we also need to add a div where we're going to add some copy this is the mandate acceptance text that's required when collecting aubex debit payments now the important thing here is that you go through and update this strong tag or the section here that says insert your business name here that should be your your company's name your business's name so that the mandate text is applicable to your business let's head over and implement bexdebit.js so once the dom is fully loaded we're first going to create an instance of the stripe object passing in our publishable key next we want to create reference to some stripe elements so we're going to use stripe.elements to create an elements object and then we're going to create an au bank account element we're going to pass in the au bank account string here which will create an au bank account element and we want to mount it to that div that we created earlier with the same id so notice that this div has a eubank account element we're using the css selector for that div so that we can mount the element into the div now when the form is submitted we want to do two things first we want to create a payment intent on the server and second we want to confirm that payment intent on the client so we're going to use the fetch api here to send a post request to slash create payment intent and again that's going to expect two arguments the payment method type and we're going to pass a u-bax debit it'll also expect the currency so again we're going to pass in australian dollars this endpoint will either resolve with an error property or with a client secret for that payment intent now if there was an error we'll use our add message method that comes from the utils helper and we'll just print out the error otherwise we'll add a little message saying that the payment intent was created next up we want to call stripe.confirmaubexdebitpayment this is going to accept a few different arguments the first is that client secret property for the payment intent that we just created and the second is going to be a big options block where we can pass in any of the billing details that we we collected earlier namely this aubex debit bank account element reference and we'll pass also the name and email so let's grab reference to that name and email by id and we'll pass in the values for the name and email that were entered by the customer now confirm aubex debit is going to return a promise that will resolve with either an error or a payment intent object and if there was an error again we will log out a message to our status messages div otherwise we will add a message showing the id and status for the payment intent all right let's take this for a whirl so we're going to refresh the page and you'll notice that this bsb and account number controls are waiting for us to enter in some account details in test mode we can enter all zeros for the bsb and there are several different test account numbers that are available in the stripe documentation next we're going to hit pay and we can see that the payment intent was created and we see the id of the payment intent here we can actually click on that link it'll bring us into the stripe dashboard where we can inspect and look at this payment that was just collected and we can see indeed it was beck's direct debit as the payment method type and it was collected for 19.99 australian dollars let's run another test here where we pass again all zeros for our bsb and then all ones with one three at the very end as another test account number this test account number will fail the payment so you can test a bunch of different scenarios as you're building out your payment flow to ensure that you're handling both the success and failure cases for these payments all right so as a quick recap from our index.html page we have a link to beck's direct debit where we first installed three javascript files and then we went down and implemented a payment form where we were collecting the name and email address and uh then we added a an au bank account element container where we use stripe.js elements to mount those bank account controls we also added this mandate acceptance div so that we were presenting the correct legal copy then we headed over to bexdebit.js where we initialized an instance of stripe set up some stripe elements and then listened for the submission of the form and handled that by first sending a post request to create payment intent with our aubex debit payment method type and australian dollars as the currency finally we called confirm au bex debit passing in the client secret that we got back from the server and payment method type referring back that au bank account element and added just a bit of logging there at the end at this point you're fully equipped to head out and build a front end to accept aubex direct debit on the front end using html and javascript if you're curious about other payment method types we have links to tons of other videos available on the stripe developer's youtube channel thank you so much for watching and we'll see in the next one you\", metadata={'source': 'IeGpu9JNvNU', 'title': 'Accept AU Becs Debit payments with Stripe.js', 'description':

Document(page_content=\"wechat is a leading lifestyle super app used for messaging between people as well as connecting people services and businesses in china and around the world through a number of e-commerce and social features inside the app wechat pay the payment wallet inside the wechat app has over 800 million users chinese consumers can use wechat pay to pay for goods and services inside of businesses apps and websites now let's have a look how we can implement wechat pay in our website so here i just have a simple form just with a simple pay button let's have a look at the html for this so here we're just having our html5 document we're loading our css and our stripe.js that's very important stripe.js version 3. we have some utility helpers to add some messages to render them and then we have our wechat page as that we're going to tell you in a second we just have our headline and then our payment form just with a submit button to pay and then a little diff to show our alert messages on our page so jumping in here the first thing once our dom is loaded we want to fetch our publishable key from the stripe server so we have our server running in the background and from the config root we're fetching the publishable key and then here we're initializing stripe.js with some base headers so at the time of recording these beta headers are required but by the time that you're watching this you will only need to pass the publisher publishable key not any of the headers great and so now when the form is submitted um we first of all prevent the default submit action and then what we want to do is make a call to our server to create a new payment intent and then get the client secret for that payment intent so we can simply do a fetch call here to our back end so we say await fetch and we have our route is create payment intent and then we'll need to pass a couple of options so first of all we need to path our method so this is um a post request here and then we want to make this request as um json so we need to pass in content type and our content type is application json and then we also need to put some body so for the body we're um just string flying a json here and specifically we are passing uh our currency so uh for wechat we're just going to use uh chinese again here and then also we need to pass the payment method type to our server which then creates the correct payment intent for us and we'll just say wechat pay so that's our payment method type and then lastly we'll need to get our response and then cast that into great so now we get our um json response back and so we can now deconstruct our response so first of all i will say here if we get an error in our response that's a backend error and otherwise we get a client secret and so now what we can do is um we can check if we have a back-end error in that case we show um we have a method here called at message so that's part of our utilities and then we can say backend error and just get the message there to render that out and if we have an error we just abort and return at this point uh but if we don't have an error we can then uh go ahead and we can confirm the payment with the client secret that we just gotten from our server uh using stripe.js and so the way this works is we are again this is an asynchronous action so on uh stripe our stripe.js we can call confirm we chat pay payment so that is fairly self-explanatory uh the wechat pay payment we pass in our client secret and then we'll just need to pass in some payment method options so payment method options and uh here specifically we're saying okay we're passing in some options for wechat pay and then what we're passing in is that we're on the web client so what this tells stripe.js is that we want to render a qr code so by default stripe.js renders our qr code in an iframe and then the user can just scan that and again here we might get an error back and let's just call that stripe error and then otherwise we get a payment intent and so what we can do now is basically just again check if we have a stripe error then we again add a message to say um stripe error dot message and we abort but if we don't have a stripe arrow we just add a message to say um let's say payment and we'll just write out the payment intent dot status and then let's also render out the payment intent id great and so that's already it we can now go ahead and test this out so let's go over let's hit pay and so now we're calling confirm payment intent and what we can do now so we are in test mode we can scan um this qr code with our um phone and it just goes to a stripe test page and then there we just authorize the test payment and what happens in the background is that we check this and then our confirm wechat pay payment method resolves with the payment intent and we now see the payment is succeeded great so that's how easily you can accept wechat pay payments from your customers in china on your website using stripe.js and html thanks for tuning in and see you next time\", metadata={'source': 'm5gfiLCpJyc', 'title': 'Accept a WeChat Pay payment with Stripe.js',

Document(page_content=\"we can add the stripe react native sdk to our react native and expo projects using either yarn or npm i'm going to show you how to do this using a new export project so i started with a blank typescript expo app and i've added a little navigation container here um using react navigation i'm just a stack navigator and i have one home screen here and one card screen in the home screen i um just have this little list view a kind of scroll view with some list items and kind of a collapse component here so i can nest different things underneath and then i have one list item called card and so when i tap on that we navigate to our card view so this is where we're going to implement the um card field in a separate video later on but for now let's go ahead and add stripe to our project so as i mentioned we can add yarn here and we're just going to add this to our project and so now we can see that stripe react native version 0 1 4 was added to our project and so now in our root view we can wrap our app into the stripe provider so that is needed to initialize a stripe now we can do this in two different ways actually so we can use the stripe provider as mentioned here and we can wrap our app or our payment screen into the stripe provider or alternatively we can use um the init stripe method in a use effect for example so when our app is loaded we then init stripe so in our case here we're just going to go with the stripe provider approach so we can import the stripe provider from stripe react native so let's do that here so stripe react native is our namespace with the add stripe and then we can import the stripe provider now we can wrap our um root of the app so our app.tcx into the stripe provider and the sprite provider requires um a publishable key to be set so here we need to provide the publishable key and so the publishable key we will need to load in our application here we can load it from the server and that's generally recommended to load the key rather than hard coding it and then we can easily also switch the keys should we need to by just changing them on our server and don't need to submit kind of a new app code so let's use a state variable here publishable key and set publishable key and we're going to say use state and so in the beginning that is just an empty string and then set publishable key so we will need to fetch uh our publishable key from the server so first of all um there are some differences in kind of loading from localhost so here in our app we just have our server so we have we're running the node server and we just have that running on localhostport4242 and so let's actually go ahead and create a new file let's call it config.ts and here we're just going to specify kind of our api url and that is different depending on what platform we're running from so let's import platform from react native and then we can say so we want to export export a const and we're just going to call it api url um and so we're saying if the platform os so if the platform os equals android then we need a specific ip address here so android is proxying localhost to 10.0.2.2 and then onport4242 and otherwise if we're on ios we can just use a good old localhost so um just 127.1 and then also on port 4242 so here we are our api url if we're running on android we get the android specific proxy and otherwise we get the localhost great and now let's actually do um another file and we're just going to call it uh helper albus.ts and so we're just going to implement a little fetch publishable key helper method here so first of all we'll import our api url from our config and then we're going to export a new function and that's an async function that is going to fetch and we're just calling it fetch publishable key and then we're just going to try catch in here so we're going to try to fetch from our api url and we have a route called config that returns our um publishable key and then we're going to destructure the publishable key from our response which comes back as json and then if that is successful we're just returning the publishable key and then we'll need to catch if we have an error uh and we can just console.log the error maybe and then we can also maybe add a little console warn and just say unable to fetch publishable key is your server running that happens to me a lot that i forget to run the server and then maybe we can also add a little alert uh and we'll need to import that alert from react native and then we can say alert.alert and maybe let's just say error and then again let's just take this so then we have our little helper method here to fetch our publishable key and so now we can use that in our app when our app loads we then want to load the publishable key so to do that we can use the use effect of react and since this is an async operation we'll need to first define kind of an async function let's just call it init and then in there just say const publishable key equals await fetch publishable key which we will also need to import from our helpers we'll just check if we have a publishable key and if we have it then we set the publishable key to our key and then we can feed it into our stripe provider great and that's everything we need to load our stripe provider let's make sure we're also closing it down here fabulous so now lastly let's run up our expo app let's just start it here in ios and now we got our um expo devtools here but one thing that you can see is that we're seeing some dependencies are incompatible with the installed expo package version so expo does actually some magic thing under the hood so it bundles the stripe react native sdk with the expo client um but the xbox line is only updated every so often so there might be a version mismatch and for things to work correctly we need to get the exact version that is being used with the current expo sdk that we're using so let's go ahead and actually change this so in our package json we find our entry for strike rack native so currently that's at two zero one four now let's set this to exactly zero one one and so now when we start again the warning should be gone no of course we first need to actually update things so let's run yarn and so now we should see this reflected and so now if we run yarn ios the warning should be gone and we are ready to go and our project is opening it's still working great and so now we're ready to implement the codfield component and actually accept credit cards thanks for tuning in and see you in

implement a react client to accept a one-time after pay clear pay payment with a custom form after pay is also known as clear pay in the uk and it's a payment method for customers to buy now and pay later so after pay provides your customers in australia canada new zealand the uk and the us a way to split their purchases over several installments so the customer only pays the first installment at purchase time and you are immediately paid in full and afterpay collects the remaining installments from your customer over time so after pay is particularly popular among businesses that are selling things like fashion beauty and sports products and in this example we're going to assume that we already have a server set up for creating payment intents and we want to add support for creating these after pay clear pay payments on the front end if you don't already have a server implemented that's all right you can head over and take a look at one of our example integrations in one of the officially supported server languages those are linked down in the description also before we get too far if you're using vanilla.js or some other implementation for your client that is not react we have episodes for accepting clearpay and after pay payments with other client implementations those are also linked down in the description our server is already up and running it has two endpoints that we're gonna interact with today one is slash config for fetching publishable keys and one is create payment intent and create payment intent takes in the payment method type and the currency so here we're going to pass in after pay clearpay as the payment method type and we're going to pass usd for our currency today now this endpoint is going to create a payment intent on the server and return just its client secret property which we'll use to confirm that payment on the client all right let's take a look at what we already have this is an app based on create react app the create react app template and in index.js the first thing we do is load our publishable key and create a stripe promise with load stripe this is a helper that comes from the npm module for stripe.js then we're going to use the elements provider and wrap our entire application and pass in just one prop that's going to be the stripe prop which is either an instance of the stripe object or a promise that will resolve to a stripe object and we want to use this elements provider and wrap the entire app so that we have access to both the stripe object and all of the react stripe.js elements components inside of the application let's head over and take a look at app.js next so appjs right now is using react router dom to create some routes we're going to add a brand new route for after pay clear pay and initially we will just render the the after pay clear pay component that is yet to be created so we're going to import that and when we import it you'll notice that we get an error because we're going to fail to compile uh because this isn't actually this doesn't exist yet so we're going to go implement a functional react component for collecting these after pay clear pay payments so in after pay clearpay.js we're going to export default with router the after pay clearpay form component initially we're going to use with router so that we can redirect from this component if we need to so the after pay clearpay form component is not going to take in any props initially and to start out we'll just return an empty string just so we can get get this thing set up we're going to import with router from react router dom and we also need to import react so that we can use jsx inside of this component all right so let's set up a basic after pay clear pay component here we'll create a head tag with the title of the payment method type and then we're going to add a form now this form is where we'll collect all of the billing details for after pay clear pay and in order to accept and after pay clear pay payment we need to collect both the billing information the billing address and shipping address and so i've organized these into separate field sets just so that we can keep them logically organized now for the billing we need to collect the name the email and then the full address so address line one line two city state a postal code and a country and so we're gonna sort of quickly scaffold out all of these different controls you'll notice that with each of these controls we're passing in a value prop and an on change prop these are going to use the use state hook in order to keep keep track of the state and sort of bind our controls in two different directions here all right now that we've got all of our form control set up we're going to import use state from react and then we'll go through creating all of our state variables and passing in some sensible defaults so that we don't have to type into the form every single time that we're trying to test this so we're going to pull out the uh and set up the name email line one two and city state zip and postal code are the the postal code and country for the billing address and we'll do the same for the shipping address all right now we can see in the browser all of our form controls are rendering for our after pay clear pay form that's looking fantastic you'll notice though that if we refresh the browser and hit pay nothing actually happens that's because we haven't wired up the submission of the form to do anything with our javascript so we're going to add an on submit handler called handle submit this is going to be an async function and we will prevent defaults that we don't cause a full page reload and when the form is submitted we want to do two things first we're going to create the payment intent on the server and second we're going to confirm that payment intent here on the client now in order to create the payment intent on the server we're going to use the fetch api that's built into the browser to send a post request to create payment intent this will return a promise that will resolve with either an error property or a client secret we're going to alias the error to back end error so we can deconflict with another error that we're going to use here shortly recall that this endpoint expects two arguments the payment method type in the currency again we're passing after pay clear pay and usd in practice you could hard code the payment method type in currency on the server you don't have to pass these in from the client the reason that we're doing this is so that we can demonstrate the widest variety of payment method type and currency combinations while still maintaining sort of the same sort of back end next we see that there is an error that says that add message is not defined so add message is a helper that comes from the status messages component so we're going to import status messages and the use messages hook from our status messages javascript file that's here we can take a quick look at it it is a small component that iterates over a list of string messages and then prints out a list of divs so we'll use the use messages hook in order to create a list of messages and an add message helper function that will add a string message to that list so messages is a list of strings an add message expects a string message and we'll add that to the list of messengers there is a method exposed from stripe called confirm after pay payment this takes in a couple of different arguments the very first one is the client secret property that was just returned from the server and the second is a big options block where we're going to pass in all the payment method details that we just collected from the client now in order to use this method from stripe.js we need to use the use stripe hook to grab reference to that stripe object that was passed down from the elements provider from index.js now if stripe is not loaded yet when the form is submitted then we're going to just add a log message that says stripe hasn't loaded yet otherwise we'll continue on with the rest of the form submission so for this confirm after pay clear pay payment we're going to start passing down all the the state variables that we've collected above and a return url so the return url is the url to which a customer will be redirected after they've gone through the payment flow in the after pay ui so they're going to be when they click pay they'll be redirected to after pay and then when they're done sort of filling out any after pay information they'll be redirected back to this return url now confirm after pay payment returns a promise that will resolve with either an error or a payment intent property all right let's take this for a spin so if we refresh the browser and hit pay then we're redirected to this after pay clear pay test payment page where we can decide to authorize the test payment or click fail test payment which will simulate the failure of a payment so let's click on authorized test payment and notice that we are redirected right back to this after pay clearpay path however in the query string we see return true so this is something that we added to our return url and now when we are returned to this route rather than just re-rendering the same component we want to refactor this a little bit so that we can render a separate component for to show the status of the payment and just to sort of thank the customer for for their payment so let's create a couple new components here we'll create the after pay clearpay component which will be sort of apparent for both the form and the return and this is where we will fork on that query string parameter so if there was return that return query string parameter then we will render the return component otherwise we will render our form component so we're going to grab reference to the query string using the use location hook we're going to say if the query string has the return key then we're going to return the after pay clearpay return component otherwise we'll return the after particular pay form component all right so for our after pay re clear pay return component this will be where we will retrieve the payment intent and display its status we are also going to import use location from react router dom so the after paid clearpay return component will again add an h1 saying this was an afterpay clearpay payment we'll add another thank you message and then again we're going to use the status messages component inside of the after pay clear pay return so that we can show the any messages that we uh would like without needing to import from the console looks like we actually forgot to add the status messages component to our form so let's do that too and then we're going to use again we're going to use the use messages hook to create a messages state variable and we're going to grab reference to stripe again and pull out the client secret from the query string parameters so if we look at the query string parameters you'll notice that one of the keys is payment intent client secret and that will have the client secret property for the payment intent in order to retrieve that payment intent from the stripe api using stripe.js we need to call stripe dot retrieve payment intent and pass in the client secret property retrieve payment intent returns a promise that will resolve with either an error property or the payment intent object if there was an error we'll log out that error to the status messages div otherwise we'll print out the payments id and its status now you'll notice that the compilation error we're seeing on the right hand side says that we we are not allowed to use a weight unless we're inside of an async function and so in order to get around this we're going to create just a little wrapper function called fetch payment intent while we're inside of this use effect hook we also need to check to make sure that stripe is loaded otherwise we'll return early okay now we can refresh the page and we see the id of the payment intent that test payment intent that we just created and in fact we can click on that that'll bring us to the stripe dashboard to show us the payment intent in the dashboard and we see that the payment intent had succeeded so this is all looking great let's go through the payment flow one last time so we'll refresh the page and click on pay we'll again authorize the test payment we're brought back to our return url where we now see the status of the payment intent and its id we can click on that payment intent id and drill into the stripe dashboard where again we see this payment for 19.99 in us dollars has succeeded all right so just as a super quick recap let's take a look back at index.js this is where the publishable key is being fetched and we're setting up the elements provider which wraps the entire application passing stripe down in app.js we imported after pay clearpay this new component that we just built and we added a new route that matches on after payclearpay to render that component then we built out this big afterpay clearpay form to collect the billing details the shipping details we added a form submission handler that said when the form is submitted we're going to create the payment intent on the server and we're going to pass the the payment method type in the currency we're going to use the client secret return from that call in order to confirm the payment on the client and we called confirm after pay clear pay payment passed in all those details that we collected from the client in order to confirm that payment when the payment was confirmed we were redirected to the after pay clear pay test page where we went through some payment flow and then we were redirected back to this return url which again had that return query string parameter allowing us to sort of switch on whether we're going to return this after pay clear pay return component or the form component and again in the after pay clearpay return component we pulled the payment intent client secret out of the query string parameter and used that to retrieve the payment intent with stripe.js when we called fetch payment intent all right so at this point you are fully equipped to go out and implement an after pay clearpay payment method in your react applications thank you so much for watching thanks for your time and attention and we'll see you in the next one\", metadata={'source': 'GS91DCwn_Ek', 'title': 'Accept an Afterpay

'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"hi there welcome to stripe developers today we are going to look at how to add one-time payments subscriptions with the stripe billing invoice items api a couple of use cases for adding one-time payments would be for a sas platform that offers onboarding trading or premium support or a subscription box service that offers specific product add-ons that can be added to the next recurring delivery to accomplish this we're going to use the stripe cli to generate a boilerplate app and stripe checkout to handle subscription creation logic first let's go ahead and pull up the stripe cli and let's create our app we'll go ahead and list all of the available stripe samples let's go ahead and grab our checkout single subscription boilerplate app i'm going to create that checkout subscription and we'll go ahead and set it to our app folder we're going to go ahead and create this in the node programming language and then let's navigate to our app folder so we can navigate to the server folder then let's install our dependencies all right and then let's start up our app so this is what this basically looks like off the boiler plate where we've got a starter and a professional service that can be used to create a subscription with stripe checkout we're going to go ahead and do is add in a ui here for our customer to add in a premium support option that will be added to their subscription before they begin it on stripe checkout so to do this we're going to use the stripe invoice items and we're going to go ahead and create an invoice item for a customer so what we're going to do first is we're going to add in our ui here this is the button that handles the professional and we'll do is we'll say add support let's rename this to port and we'll say let's say our support's worth a decent amount that's worth 50 we want to note that this is a one-time payment i change our button language to support a toggle and so what this will ultimately look like on our application is this this doesn't look too great yet we've got a little gap here that we can add and we want to be able to support a toggle here instead of just starting our subscription like we would here with one click so let's go ahead and pull up the css we've got here our various features and let's go ahead and first modify our name class to handle the support and we're going to add nice clean margin to it let's double that margin next let's go ahead and grab the button and so we're going to do here is we are going to show our space properly we're going to add a green clasp to our button to let us know that it has been toggled and then we're going to grab a variable it's already been declared to denote that it is active and similarly on hover here let's do green light rub right over it all right and let's see how this looks now in our application i've got some nice clean space in here to add support one month of support and then our toggle would function but we're gonna have to first add that in our script so this is the javascript that handles the client side initial fetching where we're going to grab our price id and the pro price id from the back end but first we're going to create a toggle to handle toggling our buttons so let's first declare a variable so that we can reuse that support button and then we don't need this middle logic here we're not going to be creating a check out yet so what we'll want to do here is create a variable to start or set it to null and we'll define so let's just set this to true for starters so we can test our toggle grab an if statement first let's define enabling it so support will start as null so it will not be true but let's see here first set support equals price id and we want our support button add our green class to it if it's enabled and then let's go ahead and add let's see here let's go ahead and make this nice and pretty and use a check mark and then to unenable it and remove and all right let's go back to our see if our toggle works nice hover here and look at that we can toggle back and forth from added it's not added but next what we'll need to do is define this so that we can get it from our back end we'll use a similar variable naming like we did for our other ones so let's go ahead and go into our server and we'll notice here that we're getting this from our environment so what we'll have to do to be able to actually fetch this is we have to go to find some variables here we got some existing placeholders and to create these what we're going to do is we're going to use some examples given in the readme file that's created in the boilerplate that shows you how to create some products and prices with the stripe cli so let's go ahead and first create our premium product great we got our premium product we're going to go ahead and grab this product id and we've got eighteen hundred dollars or eighteen dollars noting that this is incense and then we'll grab the price id from here and we'll drop this in for our pro price id and then let's go back and create a basic plan we've got our basic product make this fit for what our ui is saying drop this in here next we will do our support price call support add-on for the description and we will call it grab our product id and note here what we're gonna do is we're not going to include the recurring interval to make this a one-time price and we said it was fifty dollars and now we've got a nice clean price this is for our price id all right so we've got these variables here being declared from our environment and this is the function that we use for the client side to gather this from our server here and so we're defining this as the support price that matches here and now our support price will have be defined as the support price id so when we go to user toggle we'll toggle support to be enabled as a support price id or as null restart our app there we go now we're toggling nicely using our support price id as a variable and so now let's go ahead and look at what we need to do to actually create our port price to enable we actually start our application so uh first things first right now we're just passing the single price id but we're going to want to add in an actual support price but we're going to default it to null so that it's an optional variable and then since this is only available for our pro plan it's an optional variable we can include it in our create checkout session only for our pro button click through here and make sure we've got everything enabled this is a fetch that handles formatting our result if there's an error and now let's go look at the server side code to define how we're going to go ahead and add this as an invoice item so first we're going to grab a support price id we're going to get from the client side request and let's go ahead and looking at how we define an invoice item for customer is we have to define a customer so we'll have to create a customer first before we can assign this invoice item to them so we're going to create customer first here and then what we'll want to do is actually go ahead and say that if support price is defined that we include it up here it'll be null if it's not used is defined and we'll say the price our support price id and our customer customer variable that will have an id attached to it and then what we need to do is when we actually create the checkout session is we're going to include a customer variable to use this customer word and clear here and so what this is effectively going to do is add an invoice item to the future invoice that this customer creates which will be created here in our stripe checkout session and so let's go ahead and see how this looks we've got our support added here we're going to go for the professional oh we left out a very important e all right this takes us to our stripe checkout where we're going to note here we've got our support invoice item added and then our premium build monthly 18 subscription now you may say my additional add-on items don't quite fit a one-to-one ratio where i don't want to create all of my products on stripe so that there is a product in price for them well there's another way you can actually go and add an invoice item without having to declare this price id what we can do here instead is declare an amount variable fifty dollars uh we can give it a description we'll say the spoke port and then we need to define currency so now what we're going to do is when we have this toggle enabled we'll still we'll still use this price id even though we're not going to use it as our to enable our toggle let's go ahead and restart our demo so now when we go to start our subscription let's see that we have bespoke support here added as a invoice item that was not associated with a price id so this is a great way if you have multiple products that you don't want to define in stripe this is a great way to add them as a one-time invoice item\", metadata={'source': '9aw24Tdy40A', 'title': 'Add a one-time fee to a Subscription with Checkout', 'description':

online checkout page to complete their purchase one link can be shared with as many customers as you'd like i'll give you a quick demo of the product and i'd encourage you to dive right into your stripe dashboard and give it a try yourself here in the dashboard payment links can be found under the products tab i'll go ahead and create my very first payment link i'll have the option to choose which product i'd like to sell using this link i can either add a brand new product or choose an existing one in my stripe catalog i can allow my customers to submit promotion codes on this payment link adjust the quantity of items that they're purchasing and even collect their billing and shipping addresses here on the right hand side of my screen i can see exactly how my payment link will look and it automatically leverages the branding settings i've pre-established in stripe now i can click to create this link and i'll see this link already ready and i can now share this link i'll copy the link to my clipboard and show you exactly what it looks like for a customer who's clicking on this link as a customer i'm brought right to the checkout page i can go ahead and update the quantity of

with stripe and getting the word out about your products you can share your payment links via an email newsletter to promote your product or service on social media pages like twitter or facebook via support interactions when chatting directly with your customers and you can create qr codes so that you can redirect customers right to a payment link to complete their transaction merchants and platforms like makerpad have gotten started with stripe in less than five minutes through payment links so what's coming next well soon we'll enable non-profits and charities to use payment links with adjustable amounts that can be configured by your customers we'll also be building in taxes support local payment methods a whole suite of analytics and an api for payment links as well we can't wait

one last note if you're using react ios or android we have videos specific to those clients linked in the description for this video all right let's get started the first thing we're going to do is take a look at the endpoints that we'll interact with today on our server the first one we're going to use is config so let's make a curl request to it and this endpoint is going to return our publishable key which we'll use in our in our client with our javascript code the other endpoint we're going to call is create payment intent this endpoint is going to create a payment intent and return the client secret property to us so we're going to call this endpoint with two arguments we're going to pass a payment method type of card and the currency of usd now when you're working with google pay or apple pay and other similar wallets we use this payment method type of card so that when we're working in the javascript we can call stripe dot confirm card payment let's take a look at what we have right now in our code base and so if we start with our index.html file you can see that it's a pretty simple html file with just a single link and that goes to our googlepay.html so let's go ahead and take a look at that and here's google pay.html now this html page is already importing stripe.js it also has a reference to utils.js this is a little helper method we've included that will help us display some messages on our html page lastly we have a header for google pay and then we have a div down here where we'll show some messages okay so now to add google pay to this web page we're going to use the payment request button element from stripe js this element gives you a single integration for google pay apple pay microsoft pay and the payment request api so the way this button works is depending on what browser and device your customer is using they'll either see a branded um a branded button when they go to that page or they'll see a more generic pay now button we're going to build this today so that when they open our page in chrome they see a google pay button so the first thing we're going to do is add this element to this page and we'll do that by first by adding a container div here that our button that we can use to mount the element after it's loaded so let's add this div and we'll give it an id of payment request button and just a note that stripe element a stripe will be inserted here so the other thing we want to add to this page now is a link to our google pay.js script that we're going to build and this will really contain the meat of our integration so let's add this and then let's go ahead and and start working on that one so when we open google pay.js the first thing that we want to do is add um add a wrapper so that none of our code is executed until the dom is finished loading for our page so we'll add that wrapper here the next thing we're going to do is add a reference to stripe.js so we'll do that and we'll um initialize it with that publishable key that we fetched from our server now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a payment request object this paymentrequest object allows us to configure what the customer is going to see while they're going through the payment flow so let's do that now this is const payment request and we make a call to stripe payment request and this is a call that takes a several different several arguments so we'll start by first adding currency which will be usd we'll also add the country and then payment uh name the pay the payers the customer's name and email are also recommended so we're going to go ahead and add those now and now we get to configure what the customer is going to see during the payment flow when they're looking at the payment sheet so we're going to add um a total hash here and in it we're going to put a um create a label which will just say demo total and then we'll add an amount and that's going to be 19.99 and then this information will appear on the payment sheet for the customer the next thing we want to do is create our payment request button so we're going to do that by first creating an elements variable and then we're going to create our payment request button by calling elements.create and when we make this call we're going to pass a payment request which is the payment request object we just uh we just defined above okay so now we have that now um our paymentrequest object exposes a method called can make payment and this method is going to tell us whether or not the user is able to make a payment using their wallet so we're going to utilize that to decide whether or not to display the button so let's make a call to that and then i it generates a promise and when the promise resolves it'll provide us with a result and if there is a result and then we want to handle the result and if there is a result we're going to mount the element in that div that we created and if not we want to hide the button okay so in the case where there is a result we want to mount that div we created and so let's go and grab the id right here and we'll come back and we'll copy that here so pbutton.mount and we'll pass the the div id and if we're not able to display the button we we're going to take the same div but we're going to hide it now so we'll do document pass the id again so our payment request object will emit several events so we can say something like payment request dot on and pass payment method and we'll get an event when a new payment method has been added through the payment flow now when someone successfully goes through the google pay flow we're going to want to create a payment intent and then we're also going to want to confirm the payment on the client but for now let's just log the event okay so let's go to our browser now and see what we have and if we reload our page well here we are on our index.html we have our link to googlepay.html we're going to click on that and there's nothing there so um we're when we open this page we're not seeing anything and that's because the payment request button is not yet available and in our code when we were handling can make payment we hid the button if google pay wasn't available so let's do some debugging and just confirm that that's what's going on we'll go back to our code and add a quick little message here when we're hiding the element say google pay is unavailable back to the browser and if we reload this now we see our error message that that we're not seeing a button because google pay is unavailable so what needs to happen for us to be able to test google pay well we need to be running in chrome which we're doing we also need to have at least one card in our wallet in our google wallet i've gone ahead and added one of stripes test cards to my wallet but this is something that you'll need to do before you can get this example to work the last thing is we need to be testing using https right now we don't have a secure connection we're just using http to connect to our local server so let's set up an https connection using ngrok i've gone ahead and downloaded ngrok using homebrew and configured it and if you need any more information about how to do that you can find the links in the description to this video so i'm going to go ahead and type ngrok http 4242 to tunnel to my local server and when this starts you can see that it's given me a couple test domains and one of them is actually an https connection so let's go ahead and copy that and we'll use that to access our server from now on go back to the browser and replace localhost with our test domain we went back to index so let's click on the google pay link again ah look at that and so now we're seeing this beautiful google pay button so let's head back to google pay dot js and continue on with our payment request event handler the next step here is we need to handle the event where this payment request ui will yield a payment method id to us so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a payment intent on our server so let's make a call to that create payment intent method that we um that we looked at at the beginning of the video and we're going to add two parameters to the body here we'll add payment method type and we'll also add currency us this method is going to return a json object so we can say await right here so we can await this fetch call and this json object is going to include a client secret we're then going to take that client secret and use it when we call stripe confirmed card payment and then the next parameter we need to pass to confirm card payment is a payment method id now the payment method id we're going to use is from the payment method that was available on this event that was yield the on this event object that was yielded to us so this event will have a payment method object and then we'll grab the id there's one last parameter we want to pass here and that's handle action handle actions is false now by default confirm card payment will handle any additional actions that the customer needs to go through to complete this payment so for example it might open up a modal if the customer needs to complete 3d secure or it might redirect the customer to a bank if they needed to say enter a password for authentication we don't want any of this to happen while the payment sheet is still open so we're going to tell confirm card payment not to not to continue with any of those actions during this first attempt here to confirm the card pay confirm card payment returns a promise that we can await and which will resolve to either an error or a payment so if there's an error we want to tell the payment sheet that we weren't successful with the payment and so we'll um we'll send e-complete fail otherwise if the payment was successful then um the first thing we want to do is add e-complete success and then we're going to look at the status of the payment intent and if that status is requires action we're going to make a second call to stripe confirm card payment using the same client secretly now this time we won't pass handle actions equals false and so if the customer did need to do any sort of redirects or modals uh confirm card payment will uh we'll make sure that those are handled so let's go ahead and just add a little bit more um logging in our message divs there we can add one here and we'll add another one here if the payment was successful and in this one we can even pass the the id of the payment intent we created and lastly we'll just add one up here that lets us know how the payment intent was created and a client secret was returned so let's go try this out go back to our browser and i'll go ahead and reload this we'll click on our pay now button okay and you can see here this is our payment sheet and so you can see here's the test card that i put in my google wallet you can also see the information about the um about the payment that we supplied to the payment request object so the demo total here as a label the currency of usd and then the amount of 19.99 we're going to go ahead and click pay here i'll be prompted to enter a cvc click confirm up and the payment was successful our client secret was returned and here is the id of the resulting payment intent so we can click on this or you could cut and paste it and and take it to your dashboard and if we click on this we can go into my stripe dashboard and see the payment that we just received and view a lot more information about all right so let's just go back to our code one last time and review the steps that we took to create this payment so we started with google pay.html and we added a link to js.stripe.com as well as to googlepay.js which is that the bulk of our integration here and we added a div payment request button which is where the payment request button element will be mounted in if we go now to googlepay.js we started by wrapping all of our code in an event listener so that none of the code was executed until the page finished loading we added stripe js which we initialized with our publishable key we then created a paymentrequest object and set the various properties we wanted for the payment we created a payment request button using elements and then made a call to our paymentrequest object and if it determined that we could display the google pay button we went ahead and mounted the div in google pay.html with uh with our payment request button we then added um a listener for when uh the payment had gone through google pay and when we received that we created a payment intent on our server and we took the client secret from that payment intent as well as the payment method that the event the id of the payment method that the event supplied to us and we called stripe confirm payment so if a stripe if confirmed card payment was successful we then displayed the payment intent id and if the status of the payment intent was required action we made one final call to confirm card payment okay you're now fully equipped to build a custom payment form to accept a one-time google pay payment with stripe watch other videos in this playlist to see how you can accept different types of payment methods and as always if you have any feedback please let us know by completing the feedback form linked in the description for this video thanks again for watching and we'll see you next time [Music] you\", metadata={'source': 'GERlC3PxKgY', 'title':

'length': 1279, 'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"in this episode you'll learn how to implement the front end with html and javascript to accept a one-time apple pay payment with a custom form so if you're interested in a faster integration path for accepting payments head over to the checkout playlist in the stripe developers channel as stripe checkout supports apple pay out of the box let's say that you already have a back end set up for creating payment intents and you want to add support for accepting the apple pay payment method on the front end now if you haven't already implemented a backend you can head over and take a look at one of those server implementations in one of the officially supported server languages also before we get too far if you're using react or ios or android we have videos specific to those clients linked in the description so head over and check those out so we have a back end it's already up and running here it has two endpoints one is at slash config for fetching our publishable key and the other is at create payment intent and that accepts a payment method type which is card and then a currency so this combo of payment method type and currency allows us to create a new payment intent on the server which is going to return just its client secret property so we're going to use this client secret to confirm the payment intent on the client now note that for apple pay and google pay and wallets that are similar to this we're going to use the payment method type card and that'll allow us to confirm the card payment on the client using one of these mobile wallets all right so let's take a look at what we've already got set up here so we have an index.html file that has some very simple html right now it's a single link to applepay.html so let's go implement applepay.html and looking in here we'll see that it's just very basic html page it's already importing stripe.js from js.stripe.com and it imports a little utility function which is uh enables us to just log some messages into this messages div here and then we have just a simple header and some links so the very first thing we need to do when collecting any payment request type wallet payment like apple pay is to add a button to our html page so i can do that with a simple div here that has the id payment request button and when we mount our payment request object it's going to be or that element it's going to be mounted into this div alright the next thing i want to do is just create another script here that's going to go to apple pay dot js and we will uh we'll go implement all of that from scratch here in applepay.js so this is going to be the meat and potatoes for today's episode we're going to create a wrapper so that all of our code only runs when the page finally loads and we'll initialize an instance of stripe with our publishable key so next we're going to create the button element that is going to display that apple pay button to our customers the very first thing that we need to do here is to create a paymentrequest object so we can say const paymentrequest is equal to stripe.paymentrequest which takes in an object with a bunch of arguments so we're going to pass the currency which is usd we're going to pass the country it is recommended that you request the payer's name so we're going to say request payer name true and request payor email is true and then now we get to configure what is actually shown on the payment sheet that pops up when someone clicks on apple pay so we can pass in the total here as an object that contains a label and an amount in safari stripe.paymentrequest here is going to use applepay but in all other browsers it's just going to use the underlying payment request api this paymentrequest object allows us to configure what the customer is going to see when they're going through that payment flow now we'll create a new payment request element with stripe elements we'll say const elements is equal to stripe.elements and then we're going to say const pr button is equal to elements.create payment request button which takes in reference to this payment request object so we're going to say this payment request is uh what we want to use with this payment request button so paymentrequest objects expose a method called can make payment which returns a promise that will resolve with an argument letting us know whether or not we're allowed or able to make a payment using a mobile wallet like apple pay or google pay so here we're going to get a result and if there's a result then we can display or like mount the element otherwise we want to hide the button in the case that we're mounting the element we can say pr button dot mount and then pass in the css selector that points at that div that we created earlier so this payment request button the div with id payment dash request button is what we will use as our css selector for where to mount this pr button element that we just created and then otherwise we want to just hide that button so we'll say document.get by id pass in that same string payment request button dot style.display is none [Music] now this payment request object will emit several events we can say payment request dot on and then pass in payment method all one word all lower case and this will emit an event when a new payment method has been added uh with the payment flow like through the payment flow so when someone successfully goes through the payment flow with apple pay we would like this event to fire inside of which what we will eventually create a payment intent on the server and then confirm the payment on the client for now we'll just console.log this event object okay all right let's see what we've got going on so if we reload our or if we open up a browser we open up safari and go to localhost 4242 this is our index page and when we open up apple pay we don't see any content here and that's because the apple pay button is not yet available on this page we're not seeing anything mounted that button was hidden so let's add a little bit of debugging here that says um if we were not able to hide or if we were not able to make a payment with apple pay let's add a message that just says like apple pay is unavailable so that we have a little bit of logging here okay it doesn't look like our logging is working so let's right click and say inspect and we see an error message here that says the there's a an unhandled rejection that says the currency should be one of all of these and we specified usd all caps so let's make this lower case and then refresh the page and now we see our message is printed that says apple pay is unavailable so that's good we're making some progress here now how do we actually test that apple pay is available so in order to experiment with apple pay in test mode a number of things need to be true number one we have to be testing with https right now this is not a secure this is not a secure connection we're just using http to localhost 4242. number two we have to be testing in safari and we have to have a saved card in safari i have some saved payment details in here but that's a step that you'll need to think about whether or not you have car details already set up in safari generally we need to have a domain that's actually registered with apple pay in order for this to work and so we can't really register a local host so instead we're going to use a workaround with ngrok however depending on your setup you may have to deploy to some staging environment and then use the domain for the staging environment but we do need a public-facing domain in order to register that with apple pay so let's first set up ngrok to set up a tunnel that will allow out public connections into our local server so we can use ngrok here i've set it up with brew with homebrew so you can head over to the documentation linked in the description for more info about how to set up ngrok but we're going to say ngrok http 4242 which will start an ngrok tunnel to our local our local server so notice that it will give you both http and https urls if you'd like to load those we're going to use https which will check one of our boxes for the requirements for using applepay so now instead of using localhost here i'm going to just use our our new ngrok domain and that allows us to pull up pull up the apple pay page here and we can still see that apple pay is unavailable because we we have a couple other steps that we need to take so the next step is that we need to con register our apple pay domain so let's go over to the stripe dashboard all right now that we're logged into the dashboard we want to add that ingrock domain directly to this apple pay domain web domain settings we're going to say add domain and we can drop in that ngrok domain that is the the first step here the second step is to download a verification file so we'll click download verification file that's going to end up in my downloads and we want to host that verification file at that domain slash dot well known slash and then the name of the verification file so in our case our frontend assets are stirred are served statically from that slash client directory so we need to create a new directory called dot well known and we need to copy this domain verification file that we just downloaded into that directory so that it's hosted as expected so let's open up here and go to our client directory and add a new dot well known directory and in the well known directory we're going to move the apple developer merchant id domain association file into that client well known directory and then we're going to say add and this will verify this will register our apple pay domain and verify it so that when we come back to our browser and refresh we see this big beautiful apple pay button so now we have we're serving over https we have a registered and verified apple pay domain we have some test card details that are entered into safari which is the the the browser that we're testing the next step that we need to take is to actually handle the event where this payment request ui will yield a payment method id so let's head back over to our code and open back up apple pay.js and continue on with this payment request event handler here so step one create a payment intent on server so we're gonna make a post request to our server's create payment intent endpoint and that will return a json object that has a client secret property that we want to extract and we need to pass the payment method type as card and the currency as usd back to our back end so that when we are creating this new payment intent we know that it is confirmable with card payment methods and then it uses the usd currency next we need to confirm that card payment on the client so we can call stripe dot confirm card payment and pass in that client secret that we just got back from the server and a second our second argument here is going to be a payment method and the payment method is actually going to be an id of a payment method that's on the event object yielded to us with the payment request api so this e this e-event object it's going to have a payment method property that will have the data about that payment method and it'll have its id next we want to say handle actions false this is a third argument to confirm card payment and we're saying don't handle any next actions like presenting the modal or redirecting to maybe the the bank's page that requires some one-time password so confirm card payment is going to open modals if there's 3d secure required and it'll handle secure customer authentication things like that we don't want that to happen while the payment sheet is open for apple pay so we want to say handle actions false for this first attempt to confirm the card payment so we're going to say so this confirm card payment method returns a promise that we can await and what if the promise the promise will resolve with either a an error or a payment intent object okay so if we get an error or if we receive an error from the payment the confirm card payment method so if error then we want to tell the payment sheet that there was some sort of failure so we can say e dot complete and pass in fail and that will fail the payment flow and it'll either keep the payment sheet open or it'll show an error so we can say return otherwise if there was a payment intent and its status was requires action then we want to call confirm card payment again with that same client secret so that if there were any modals that needed to be opened or redirects they need to happen those can happen so we'll say stripe dot confirm card payment again passing in the client secret and before we call that we actually do want to call e dot complete success here this will close the payment sheet until apple pay that the payment was successful let's add let's add just a little bit of logging so we'll say add message we client secret returned and we'll add a message here that says payment failed and we'll add a message down here that says payment succeeded and we'll put we can just put in the uh the id of the payment intent all right so we're going to click on this big apple pay button we see the sheet open we see processing and we're prompted to pay with touch id so on the touch bar i'm seeing touch id to pay demo 19.99 if i click or if i authenticate with my fingerprint i see processing payment and then the payment method is yielded from that on payment method event type and we can see that the payment succeeded so this is awesome we see that the payment was actually successful and if we click on this link or copy this id and visit that in our stripe dashboard we can see more details about this payment we see that it succeeded which payment method type it used and a few more details here all right so in review we added a little bit of html here to create a payment request button then we created a brand new javascript file called applepay.js where we said when the dom is ready initialize a new instance of stripe create a paymentrequest object and create an instance of a paymentrequestbuttonelement that we are going to then mount onto the page if the payment request can make a payment uh and then when a payment method is yielded to uh from the payment request object we're going to make a post request to the back end passing in our card and currency in order to create a new payment intent which we're then going to confirm client side here using confirm card payment and if there's some sort of failure we're going to tell the payment sheet that it failed otherwise we're going to say that it was successful and we're going to check and see if the payment intent status requires action then we're going to attempt to rerun the confirm card payment logic with that same client secret that we had from the server which will resolve any front-end next steps that are required you're now fully equipped to build a custom payment flow to accept a one-time apple pay payment with stripe you can head over and watch some other videos in this playlist to see how to accept different types of payment methods as always if you have any feedback please let us know by completing that feedback form linked in the description thanks so much and

payment method used by customers in china on the web you can use stripe.js to redirect your customer to an alipay page that when they visit it on their phone will automatically open the alipay app and if they visit it on a desktop device the page will show a qr code that the customer can scan with their alipay app to approve the payment so to get started i have a simple web page here just with a title and a little form to collect the customer's name and a pay button here so this is just a simple html5 file here we're loading a style sheet we're loading stripe.js from stripe.com we have some utility javascript and then we have our alipay javascript file and here you can see just our form with the one input field and the button here and then lastly we have a little diff container also to display some messages so in our alipay js file uh the first thing we're doing is we're fetching the stripe publishable key from our web server so for that to work we will need to start up our web server here i'm using the node server and you can see it is now running on localhost 4242 if you want to learn how you initialize stripe.js in an html page and load the publisher key from your server you can watch the videos that are linked in the description below so here we're just fetching our config route and we will get back a publishable key and then we're just initializing stripe.js with our publishable key next we get a reference to our payment form and we just attach submit eventlistener but here in our case we don't actually want to submit the page so we say event prevent default and so now what we actually need to do is make a call to our server's backend to create a payment intent and get the client secret to then redirect off to the alipay payment page so let's do a fetch here so our route is create payment intent and then we will need to pass in some headers so we need to to uh send this as a post request to our web server uh we then need some headers specifically we need the uh content type type header and we need to send it as application json and then we also need to pass some data so we just uh stringify a json object here and send that as our body and so we need to specify our currency um i'm just running on a us stripe account here so i'm just going to use usd for this and then we also need to pass the payment method type so that our backend can create a payment intent for alipay usage and then lastly we need to transform our response into json and so when this resolves we will get some values back that we can destructure we get a response back that we can to structure here first of all we get an error let's rename that to backend error and then if things were successful we get a client secret great so now we are fetching our client secret here and so once we have uh the client secret uh first of all let's actually make sure that we don't have a back-end error so if we have a backend error we then just add a message and that is a helper function from our utils javascript and we just say backend error top message and then also if there was an error we actually want to abort our function here but otherwise we add a little message to say that we have our client secret and now we can actually get [Music] go on and redirect off to the alipay payment page so uh let's actually first get our name from the input so let's say and our name input has the id name and then um what we now want to do is we want to confirm the payment intent and that's what we do with um our client secret and then this will uh send us over to the alipay page so let's go ahead and call stripe and we have a method on stripe that's called confirm alipay payment and here we will need to pass in a couple of things first of all we need to pass in our client secret from above and then we can pass in some options and so we pass in here the payment method billing details so that's where we can send our name so here that is the name and we get the name from our input above and then we also need to provide a return url so confirm alipay payment when successful will actually redirect off to the alipay page and so what we can do here is let's just get our origin from the page where we are at the moment and then we return to alipay return dot html where we then check if the payment intent was successful and so here we get also an error we can maybe name that the stripe error so if there was an error then we want to also check this so we say if there was a stripe error then um we add a message so stripe error dot message and otherwise we will actually be redirected off to our page so maybe let's just say add message uh redirecting to alipay great let's give that a save and uh go back to our page and now when we hit the pay button we get the client secret was returned and now we're actually being redirected to alipay so we're running here in test mode so we actually see a stripe hosted test mode page uh but that's kind of all we need for validating that our page is actually working we see here the payment is for 19.99 us dollar with alipay and then we can simulate the test payment success and failure states so let's authorize the payment here and we get back to our alipay return and you can see here the payment intent id and the client secret are appended as well as the redirect status and so we can quickly look into our alipay return js so here what we're doing is just again we're fetching the publishable key and then using the client the payment intent client secret from our url we can then use stripe.js to retrieve

the payment succeeded and then that will actually link you to your stripe dashboard great that's it that's all you need to start accepting alipay payments from your customers in china go ahead and

basic server-side implementation for accepting a one-time payment with a custom form if you're interested in a faster integration path using stripe hosted checkout head over to the checkout playlist in the stripe developer channel so the payment flow you'll see today for collecting a one-time payment has two steps first creating the payment intent on the server and second confirming the payment on the client using the client secret for the payment intent in this episode you'll learn how to add an endpoint to your server to create the payment intent so depending on whether you're using vanilla.js or react on the web or stripe ios or stripe android on mobile you can watch videos for those specific front-end implementations that will co that will pair with the code we implement here so rather than start from scratch we're going to jump start our server implementation using the developer office hours based sample so if you want to see how we go from zero to one check out the starter episode linked in the description you might also be interested in an episode about working with the stripe cli it's a handy tool for helping you build and test your stripe integration all right so from the terminal we're going to run stripe samples create developer office hours and we'll give this one an alias of tutorial we can now pick dot net and that'll download and scaffold a bare bones project with a simple client with some html and a server solution for us so in this episode we're going to spend all of our time in the server directory and in future episodes we'll implement those frontends to confirm payment so let's change into the server directory and open up server dot solution all right you'll see that it already contains a root route for rendering basic html using the use web root and passing in the path to the client-side code using an environment variable you notice it also has a skeleton already for the webhook endpoint now at a minimum we need to add one new server endpoint to create a payment intent that will later confirm on the front end let's stick with the same naming convention as the stripe docs and we'll name our route create payment intent this will be a post route as byron convention we're creating a new resource a payment intent so the logic in this route is very simple we'll create a payment intent using the stripe.net client library to make an api request to stripe initially we'll hard code and pass just the minimum required argument so amount and currency this amount value is denoted in the smallest denomination for a given currency so in this case sense we'll initialize an instance of the payment intent service with our client instance and then call create async to make the api call to stripe finally we need to return some json with only the client secret property of that newly created payment intent we'll fire up the server by pushing the play button here in the top left and then jump into a terminal to test with curl this is going to be a post request to localhost 4242 with an empty object in the request body notice the response is well-formed json and includes the client secret for the newly created payment intent so for this demo we actually want the client secret to be camel case rather than snake case in order to match some of our other server implementations and to match the client so in practice it doesn't matter either way and it doesn't matter what you name the property return to the client just as long as we're sending this client secret it should work so we'll need to create a model with newtonsoft json property attributes to override the name of the property to use camelcase we'll name the class create payment intent response let's test again okay that looks great and has a camel cased client secret property returning to our controller code let's talk about this api call for creating a payment intent again so there's more than two dozen optional parameters available for tailoring the payment experience for your customers one of those optional parameters is payment method types which takes a list of string for the payment method options you'd like to allow your customers to pay with now by default this is a list of string with just one entry and that's the word card making this payment intent only confirmable with card payment methods so in practice you could hard code a list of values for all the different payment method types you want to accept here but in this series you're going to learn how to accept a wide variety of payment method types so let's refactor our endpoint to accept some arguments by deserializing the json body we'll create a new class called create payment intent request so that we can use model binding and in this class we'll extract an argument for the payment method type and furthermore some payment method types only work with specific currencies so let's allow the currency to be passed from the client as well we'll wire up the model binding arguments to the controller action and pass those down to the options let's head back to the terminal and update our crow request to pass in the payment method type and the currency in the request body cool that works but if we try to pass aubex debit as our payment method type and we leave usd as the currency notice this fails in this case we get a big failure response with an error message explaining that au bex debit only works with australian dollars if we update our curl request and pass in aud the server responds with a client secret as expected now in the future we'll want to surface these failures in a nice format so that the front end can consistently parse and present those errors to customers so let's wrap the api call and try catch block and if there's a stripe exception thrown we'll respond with a 400 and follow the structure where the response has an error property pointing at an object with a string message this matches the shape returned directly from the stripe api for client-side calls so it'll make implementing error handling logic on the clients just a bit easier to reason about all right so after restarting and attempting to create a payment intent with an invalid combo of payment method type and currency we now see a well-formed error response so most payment method types complete payment asynchronously for some payments complete nearly instantly like cards but for others payments can take a few days or even more to complete due to the asynchronous nature of the way money flows through networks we highly recommend implementing webhooks to automate fulfillment so we have episodes all about how to set up your web hook handler let's update our webhook endpoint to simply print to the server log when payment intent events fire it's quite common to automate things like sending email notifications or updating your database or pulling from inventory printing shipping labels and more as part of your webhook handler also worth noting is that you could use a third-party tool like zapier or ift as a low or no code solution for handling web notifications for now we're going to simply check to see if the event type is one of payment intent doc created and print a simple status update from the terminal we'll test our new webhook logic with the stripe cli using the listen command stripe listen forms a direct connection from stripe to this locally running server so that when events happen on the demo stripe account they're going to be delivered to the development server without needing any tunneling software like ngrok the stripe listen command accepts a url to which events should be forwarded we're going to add this dash l so that we're using latest event or the latest version of the api when generating event objects now if we successfully create a new payment intent see in the server log that the payment intent was created and we can see in the logs for stripe listen that the payment intent event fired all right let's improve our log statement to include the ids of the event and the payment intent and the status of the payment intent when receiving these event types that start with payment intent dot an instance of the payment intent is available on event.data.object and here we're doing some casting so we have the right type of instance we'll restart the server and fire another test to confirm our improved log statement and now we see the id of the event the id of the payment intent and the status of the payment intent note that this payment intent was not created with a specific payment method so its statuses requires payment method we'll assign a new payment method when confirming on the front end again covered in a future episode so as we add support for more payment method types in the future it'll be interesting to see these status messages in the server logs and align those with what the customer sees and with the various states for payment intents so note that depending on which payment method types you plan to support and which automations you're looking to build you likely won't need to handle every single one of these event types so at this point the server is technically ready to add a front end however we'll add one last simple config route for fetching a publishable key so we don't need to hard code that on the front end this simple helper is purely for serving our publishable keys when receiving a get request to slash config this is a best practice when working with mobile clients so that if for some reason you need to roll your api keys the publishable key is not hard-coded into production mobile apps shipped to users that would require that all mobile users install an updated version of the app to get the new key all right so as a quick recap we added a new endpoint to create payment intents the api call to the create the payment intent passes the amount the currency and now the type of payment methods we want to allow and we also added some logging to the webhook handler for debugging and looking to the future when implementing application logic to automate fulfillment and finally we added a quick helper for returning the publishable key so that we don't have to hard code that in the mobile clients next we recommend heading over to one of the playlists that most closely fits your frontend

currency so in this case sense and this params class comes from the com.stripe.param namespace in stripe java so we'll go import that next we'll make the api call to stripe and this could raise an exception so we'll need to wrap in a try catch so for now if there's an exception we'll print it to the console and return an empty string and we'll come back to this and clean it up in a bit now rather than return the json for the entire payment intent we actually just want to return some json with only the client secret property of the newly created payment intent we can either create a static class and build a response object and serialize but since this is such a small one property json object we can just create a hash map and then render that back with json all right let's jump into another terminal instance so we can package and start the server with mvn package and we're going to call java passing it the class path to this this jar file that has all the dependencies built in and the the class path to our our entry point of server next we'll experiment with the endpoint using curl to make a direct request to the payment intent endpoint this is going to be a post request

really get a good error response so in the future we're going to want to surface those failures in a nice format so that our front end can consistently parse and present errors to customers so let's render an error response with well-formed json in a failure case so we can import stripe exception from com.stripe.exception and then add a cache for stripe exception and render a user-friendly message like so in the case of a just generic exception we'll render back and we'll just sort of like convert that error or that exception into the string value and we'll keep that the shape of the

from the stripe dashboard and share that link with all your customers when they click on that link your customers will be brought to an online checkout page to complete their purchase one link can be shared with as many customers as you'd like i'll give you a quick demo of the product and i'd encourage you to dive right into your stripe dashboard and give it a try yourself here in the dashboard payment links can be found under the products tab i'll go ahead and create my very first payment link i'll have the option to choose which product i'd like to sell using this link i can either add a brand new product or choose an existing one in my stripe catalog i can allow my customers to submit promotion codes on this payment link adjust the quantity of items that they're purchasing and even collect their billing and shipping addresses here on the right hand side of my screen i can see exactly how my payment link will look and it automatically leverages the branding settings i've pre-established in stripe now i can click to create this link and i'll see this link already ready and i can now share this link i'll copy the link to my clipboard and show you exactly what it looks like for a customer who's clicking on this link as a customer i'm brought right to the checkout page i can go ahead and update the quantity of items i'd like to purchase and also use a promotion code then i'll fill in all of my payment details finally i'll go ahead and complete my purchase payment links is the easiest way of getting started with stripe and getting the word out about your products you can share your payment links via an email newsletter to promote your product or service on social media pages like twitter or facebook via support interactions when chatting directly with your customers and you can create qr codes so that you can redirect customers right to a payment link to complete their transaction merchants and platforms like makerpad have gotten started with stripe in less than five minutes through payment links so what's coming next well soon we'll enable non-profits and charities to use payment links with adjustable amounts that can be configured by your customers we'll also be building in taxes support local payment methods a whole suite of analytics and an api for payment links as well we can't wait to see all that you do with payment links\",

payment using google pay now if you're looking for a faster integration path head over to our stripe checkout playlist on the stripe developers youtube channel since checkout comes with support for google pay straight out of the box now in this example we're going to assume that you already have a server up and running and are looking to just add support for google pay in the client if you don't already have a server integration take a look at one of our example integrations in our officially supported server languages one last note if you're using react ios or android we have videos specific to those clients linked in the description for this video all right let's get started the first thing we're going to do is take a look at the endpoints that we'll interact with today on our server the first one we're going to use is config so let's make a curl request to it and this endpoint is going to return our publishable key which we'll use in our in our client with our javascript code the other endpoint we're going to call is create payment intent this endpoint is going to create a payment intent and return the client secret property to us so we're going to call this endpoint with two arguments we're going to pass a payment method type of card and the currency of usd now when you're working with google pay or apple pay and other similar wallets we use this payment method type of card so that when we're working in the javascript we can call stripe dot confirm card payment let's take a look at what we have right now in our code base and so if we start with our index.html file you can see that it's a pretty simple html file with just a single link and that goes to our googlepay.html so let's go ahead and take a look at that and here's google pay.html now this html page is already importing stripe.js it also has a reference to utils.js this is a little helper method we've included that will help us display some messages on our html page lastly we have a header for google pay and then we have a div down here where we'll show some messages okay so now to add google pay to this web page we're going to use the payment request button element from stripe js this element gives you a single integration for google pay apple pay microsoft pay and the payment request api so the way this button works is depending on what browser and device your customer is using they'll either see a branded um a branded button when they go to that page or they'll see a more generic pay now button we're going to build this today so that when they open our page in chrome they see a google pay button so the first thing we're going to do is add this element to this page and we'll do that by first by adding a container div here that our button that we can use to mount the element after it's loaded so let's add this div and we'll give it an id of payment request button and just a note that stripe element a stripe will be inserted here so the other thing we want to add to this page now is a link to our google pay.js script that we're going to build and this will really contain the meat of our integration so let's add this and then let's go ahead and and start working on that one so when we open google pay.js the first thing that we want to do is add um add a wrapper so that none of our code is executed until the dom is finished loading for our page so we'll add that wrapper here the next thing we're going to do is add a reference to stripe.js so we'll do that and we'll um initialize it with that publishable key that we fetched from our server now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a payment request object this paymentrequest object allows us to configure what the customer is going to see while they're going through the payment flow so let's do that now this is const payment request and we make a call to stripe payment request and this is a call that takes a several different several arguments so we'll start by first adding currency which will be usd we'll also add the country and then payment uh name the pay the payers the customer's name and email are also recommended so we're going to go ahead and add those now and now we get to configure what the customer is going to see during the payment flow when they're looking at the payment sheet so we're going to add um a total hash here and in it we're going to put a um create a label which will just say demo total and then we'll add an amount and that's going to be 19.99 and then this information will appear on the payment sheet for the customer the next thing we want to do is create our payment request button so we're going to do that by first creating an elements variable and then we're going to create our payment request button by calling elements.create and when we make this call we're going to pass a payment request which is the payment request object we just uh we just defined above okay so now we have that now um our paymentrequest object exposes a method called can make payment and this method is going to tell us whether or not the user is able to make a payment using their wallet so we're going to utilize that to decide whether or not to display the button so let's make a call to that and then i it generates a promise and when the promise resolves it'll provide us with a result and if there is a result and then we want to handle the result and if there is a result we're going to mount the element in that div that we created and if not we want to hide the button okay so in the case where there is a result we want to mount that div we created and so let's go and grab the id right here and we'll come back and we'll copy that here so pbutton.mount and we'll pass the the div id and if we're not able to display the button we we're going to take the same div but we're going to hide it now so we'll do document pass the id again so our payment request object will emit several events so we can say something like payment request dot on and pass payment method and we'll get an event when a new payment method has been added through the payment flow now when someone successfully goes through the google pay flow we're going to want to create a payment intent and then we're also going to want to confirm the payment on the client but for now let's just log the event okay so let's go to our browser now and see what we have and if we reload our page well here we are on our index.html we have our link to googlepay.html we're going to click on that and there's nothing there so um we're when we open this page we're not seeing anything and that's because the payment request button is not yet available and in our code when we were handling can make payment we hid the button if google pay wasn't available so let's do some debugging and just confirm that that's what's going on we'll go back to our code and add a quick little message here when we're hiding the element say google pay is unavailable back to the browser and if we reload this now we see our error message that that we're not seeing a button because google pay is unavailable so what needs to happen for us to be able to test google pay well we need to be running in chrome which we're doing we also need to have at least one card in our wallet in our google wallet i've gone ahead and added one of stripes test cards to my wallet but this is something that you'll need to do before you can get this example to work the last thing is we need to be testing using https right now we don't have a secure connection we're just using http to connect to our local server so let's set up an https connection using ngrok i've gone ahead and downloaded ngrok using homebrew and configured it and if you need any more information about how to do that you can find the links in the description to this video so i'm going to go ahead and type ngrok http 4242 to tunnel to my local server and when this starts you can see that it's given me a couple test domains and one of them is actually an https connection so let's go ahead and copy that and we'll use that to access our server from now on go back to the browser and replace localhost with our test domain we went back to index so let's click on the google pay link again ah look at that and so now we're seeing this beautiful google pay button so let's head back to google pay dot js and continue on with our payment request event handler the next step here is we need to handle the event where this payment request ui will yield a payment method id to us so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a payment intent on our server so let's make a call to that create payment intent method that we um that we looked at at the beginning of the video and we're going to add two parameters to the body here we'll add payment method type and we'll also add currency us this method is going to return a json object so we can say await right here so we can await this fetch call and this json object is going to include a client secret we're then going to take that client secret and use it when we call stripe confirmed card payment and then the next parameter we need to pass to confirm card payment is a payment method id now the payment method id we're going to use is from the payment method that was available on this event that was yield the on this event object that was yielded to us so this event will have a payment method object and then we'll grab the id there's one last parameter we want to pass here and that's handle action handle actions is false now by default confirm card payment will handle any additional actions that the customer needs to go through to complete this payment so for example it might open up a modal if the customer needs to complete 3d secure or it might redirect the customer to a bank if they needed to say enter a password for authentication we don't want any of this to happen while the payment sheet is still open so we're going to tell confirm card payment not to not to continue with any of those actions during this first attempt here to confirm the card pay confirm card payment returns a promise that we can await and which will resolve to either an error or a payment so if there's an error we want to tell the payment sheet that we weren't successful with the payment and so we'll um we'll send e-complete fail otherwise if the payment was successful then um the first thing we want to do is add e-complete success and then we're going to look at the status of the payment intent and if that status is requires action we're going to make a second call to stripe confirm card payment using the same client secretly now this time we won't pass handle actions equals false and so if the customer did need to do any sort of redirects or modals uh confirm card payment will uh we'll make sure that those are handled so let's go ahead and just add a little bit more um logging in our message divs there we can add one here and we'll add another one here if the payment was successful and in this one we can even pass the the id of the payment intent we created and lastly we'll just add one up here that lets us know how the payment intent was created and a client secret was returned so let's go try this out go back to our browser and i'll go ahead and reload this we'll click on our pay now button okay and you can see here this is our payment sheet and so you can see here's the test card that i put in my google wallet you can also see the information about the um about the payment that we supplied to the payment request object so the demo total here as a label the currency of usd and then the amount of 19.99 we're going to go ahead and click pay here i'll be prompted to enter a cvc click confirm up and the payment was successful our client secret was returned and here is the id of the resulting payment intent so we can click on this or you could cut and paste it and and take it to your dashboard and if we click on this we can go into my stripe dashboard and see the payment that we just received and view a lot more information about all right so let's just go back to our code one last time and review the steps that we took to create this payment so we started with google pay.html and we added a link to js.stripe.com as well as to googlepay.js which is that the bulk of our integration here and we added a div payment request button which is where the payment request button element will be mounted in if we go now to googlepay.js we started by wrapping all of our code in an event listener so that none of the code was executed until the page finished loading we added stripe js which we initialized with our publishable key we then created a paymentrequest object and set the various properties we wanted for the payment we created a payment request button using elements and then made a call to our paymentrequest object and if it determined that we could display the google pay button we went ahead and mounted the div in google pay.html with uh with our payment request button we then added um a listener for when uh the payment had gone through google pay and when we received that we created a payment intent on our server and we took the client secret from that payment intent as well as the payment method that the event the id of the payment method that the event supplied to us and we called stripe confirm payment so if a stripe if confirmed card payment was successful we then displayed the payment intent id and if the status of the payment intent was required action we made one final call to confirm card payment okay you're now fully equipped to build a custom payment form to accept a one-time google pay payment with stripe watch other videos in this playlist to see how you can accept different types of payment methods and as always if you have any feedback please let us know by completing the feedback form linked in the description for this video thanks again for

learn how to implement the front end with html and javascript to accept a one-time apple pay payment with a custom form so if you're interested in a faster integration path for accepting payments head over to the checkout playlist in the stripe developers channel as stripe checkout supports apple pay out of the box let's say that you already have a back end set up for creating payment intents and you want to add support for accepting the apple pay payment method on the front end now if you haven't already implemented a backend you can head over and take a look at one of those server implementations in one of the officially supported server languages also before we get too far if you're using react or ios or android we have videos specific to those clients linked in the description so head over and check those out so we have a back end it's already up and running here it has two endpoints one is at slash config for fetching our publishable key and the other is at create payment intent and that accepts a payment method type which is card and then a currency so this combo of payment method type and currency allows us to create a new payment intent on the server which is going to return just its client secret property so we're going to use this client secret to confirm the payment intent on the client now note that for apple pay and google pay and wallets that are similar to this we're going to use the payment method type card and that'll allow us to confirm the card payment on the client using one of these mobile wallets all right so let's take a look at what we've already got set up here so we have an index.html file that has some very simple html right now it's a single link to applepay.html so let's go implement applepay.html and looking in here we'll see that it's just very basic html page it's already importing stripe.js from js.stripe.com and it imports a little utility function which is uh enables us to just log some messages into this messages div here and then we have just a simple header and some links so the very first thing we need to do when collecting any payment request type wallet payment like apple pay is to add a button to our html page so i can do that with a simple div here that has the id payment request button and when we mount our payment request object it's going to be or that element it's going to be mounted into this div alright the next thing i want to do is just create another script here that's going to go to apple pay dot js and we will uh we'll go implement all of that from scratch here in applepay.js so this is going to be the meat and potatoes for today's episode we're going to create a wrapper so that all of our code only runs when the page finally loads and we'll initialize an instance of stripe with our publishable key so next we're going to create the button element that is going to display that apple pay button to our customers the very first thing that we need to do here is to create a paymentrequest object so we can say const paymentrequest is equal to stripe.paymentrequest which takes in an object with a bunch of arguments so we're going to pass the currency which is usd we're going to pass the country it is recommended that you request the payer's name so we're going to say request payer name true and request payor email is true and then now we get to configure what is actually shown on the payment sheet that pops up when someone clicks on apple pay so we can pass in the total here as an object that contains a label and an amount in safari stripe.paymentrequest here is going to use applepay but in all other browsers it's just going to use the underlying payment request api this paymentrequest object allows us to configure what the customer is going to see when they're going through that payment flow now we'll create a new payment request element with stripe elements we'll say const elements is equal to stripe.elements and then we're going to say const pr button is equal to elements.create payment request button which takes in reference to this payment request object so we're going to say this payment request is uh what we want to use with this payment request button so paymentrequest objects expose a method called can make payment which returns a promise that will resolve with an argument letting us know whether or not we're allowed or able to make a payment using a mobile wallet like apple pay or google pay so here we're going to get a result and if there's a result then we can display or like mount the element otherwise we want to hide the button in the case that we're mounting the element we can say pr button dot mount and then pass in the css selector that points at that div that we created earlier so this payment request button the div with id payment dash request button is what we will use as our css selector for where to mount this pr button element that we just created and then otherwise we want to just hide that button so we'll say document.get by id pass in that same string payment request button dot style.display is none [Music] now this payment request object will emit several events we can say payment request dot on and then pass in payment method all one word all lower case and this will emit an event when a new payment method has been added uh with the payment flow like through the payment flow so when someone successfully goes through the payment flow with apple pay we would like this event to fire inside of which what we will eventually create a payment intent on the server and then confirm the payment on the client for now we'll just console.log this event object okay all right let's see what we've got going on so if we reload our or if we open up a browser we open up safari and go to localhost 4242 this is our index page and when we open up apple pay we don't see any content here and that's because the apple pay button is not yet available on this page we're not seeing anything mounted that button was hidden so let's add a little bit of debugging here that says um if we were not able to hide or if we were not able to make a payment with apple pay let's add a message that just says like apple pay is unavailable so that we have a little bit of logging here okay it doesn't look like our logging is working so let's right click and say inspect and we see an error message here that says the there's a an unhandled rejection that says the currency should be one of all of these and we specified usd all caps so let's make this lower case and then refresh the page and now we see our message is printed that says apple pay is unavailable so that's good we're making some progress here now how do we actually test that apple pay is available so in order to experiment with apple pay in test mode a number of things need to be true number one we have to be testing with https right now this is not a secure this is not a secure connection we're just using http to localhost 4242. number two we have to be testing in safari and we have to have a saved card in safari i have some saved payment details in here but that's a step that you'll need to think about whether or not you have car details already set up in safari generally we need to have a domain that's actually registered with apple pay in order for this to work and so we can't really register a local host so instead we're going to use a workaround with ngrok however depending on your setup you may have to deploy to some staging environment and then use the domain for the staging environment but we do need a public-facing domain in order to register that with apple pay so let's first set up ngrok to set up a tunnel that will allow out public connections into our local server so we can use ngrok here i've set it up with brew with homebrew so you can head over to the documentation linked in the description for more info about how to set up ngrok but we're going to say ngrok http 4242 which will start an ngrok tunnel to our local our local server so notice that it will give you both http and https urls if you'd like to load those we're going to use https which will check one of our boxes for the requirements for using applepay so now instead of using localhost here i'm going to just use our our new ngrok domain and that allows us to pull up pull up the apple pay page here and we can still see that apple pay is unavailable because we we have a couple other steps that we need to take so the next step is that we need to con register our apple pay domain so let's go over to the stripe dashboard all right now that we're logged into the dashboard we want to add that ingrock domain directly to this apple pay domain web domain settings we're going to say add domain and we can drop in that ngrok domain that is the the first step here the second step is to download a verification file so we'll click download verification file that's going to end up in my downloads and we want to host that verification file at that domain slash dot well known slash and then the name of the verification file so in our case our frontend assets are stirred are served statically from that slash client directory so we need to create a new directory called dot well known and we need to copy this domain verification file that we just downloaded into that directory so that it's hosted as expected so let's open up here and go to our client directory and add a new dot well known directory and in the well known directory we're going to move the apple developer merchant id domain association file into that client well known directory and then we're going to say add and this will verify this will register our apple pay domain and verify it so that when we come back to our browser and refresh we see this big beautiful apple pay button so now we have we're serving over https we have a registered and verified apple pay domain we have some test card details that are entered into safari which is the the the browser that we're testing the next step that we need to take is to actually handle the event where this payment request ui will yield a payment method id so let's head back over to our code and open back up apple pay.js and continue on with this payment request event handler here so step one create a payment intent on server so we're gonna make a post request to our server's create payment intent endpoint and that will return a json object that has a client secret property that we want to extract and we need to pass the payment method type as card and the currency as usd back to our back end so that when we are creating this new payment intent we know that it is confirmable with card payment methods and then it uses the usd currency next we need to confirm that card payment on the client so we can call stripe dot confirm card payment and pass in that client secret that we just got back from the server and a second our second argument here is going to be a payment method and the payment method is actually going to be an id of a payment method that's on the event object yielded to us with the payment request api so this e this e-event object it's going to have a payment method property that will have the data about that payment method and it'll have its id next we want to say handle actions false this is a third argument to confirm card payment and we're saying don't handle any next actions like presenting the modal or redirecting to maybe the the bank's page that requires some one-time password so confirm card payment is going to open modals if there's 3d secure required and it'll handle secure customer authentication things like that we don't want that to happen while the payment sheet is open for apple pay so we want to say handle actions false for this first attempt to confirm the card payment so we're going to say so this confirm card payment method returns a promise that we can await and what if the promise the promise will resolve with either a an error or a payment intent object okay so if we get an error or if we receive an error from the payment the confirm card payment method so if error then we want to tell the payment sheet that there was some sort of failure so we can say e dot complete and pass in fail and that will fail the payment flow and it'll either keep the payment sheet open or it'll show an error so we can say return otherwise if there was a payment intent and its status was requires action then we want to call confirm card payment again with that same client secret so that if there were any modals that needed to be opened or redirects they need to happen those can happen so we'll say stripe dot confirm card payment again passing in the client secret and before we call that we actually do want to call e dot complete success here this will close the payment sheet until apple pay that the payment was successful let's add let's add just a little bit of logging so we'll say add message we client secret returned and we'll add a message here that says payment failed and we'll add a message down here that says payment succeeded and we'll put we can just put in the uh the id of the payment intent all right so we're going to click on this big apple pay button we see the sheet open we see processing and we're prompted to pay with touch id so on the touch bar i'm seeing touch id to pay demo 19.99 if i click or if i authenticate with my fingerprint i see processing payment and then the payment method is yielded from that on payment method event type and we can see that the payment succeeded so this is awesome we see that the payment was actually successful and if we click on this link or copy this id and visit that in our stripe dashboard we can see more details about this payment we see that it succeeded which payment method type it used and a few more details here all right so in review we added a little bit of html here to create a payment request button then we created a brand new javascript file called applepay.js where we said when the dom is ready initialize a new instance of stripe create a paymentrequest object and create an instance of a paymentrequestbuttonelement that we are going to then mount onto the page if the payment request can make a payment uh and then when a payment method is yielded to uh from the payment request object we're going to make a post request to the back end passing in our card and currency in order to create a new payment intent which we're then going to confirm client side here using confirm card payment and if there's some sort of failure we're going to tell the payment sheet that it failed otherwise we're going to say that it was successful and we're going to check and see if the payment intent status requires action then we're going to attempt to rerun the confirm card payment logic with that same client secret that we had from the server which will resolve any front-end next steps that are required you're now fully equipped to build a custom payment flow to accept a one-time apple pay payment with stripe you can head over and watch some other videos in this playlist

payment method used by customers in china on the web you can use stripe.js to redirect your customer to an alipay page that when they visit it on their phone will automatically open the alipay app and if they visit it on a desktop device the page will show a qr code that the customer can scan with their alipay app to approve the payment so to get started i have a simple web page here just with a title and a little form to collect the customer's name and a pay button here so this is just a simple html5 file here we're loading a style sheet we're loading stripe.js from stripe.com we have some utility javascript and then we have our alipay javascript file and here you can see just our form with the one input field and the button here and then lastly we have a little diff container also to display some messages so in our alipay js file uh the first thing we're doing is we're fetching the stripe publishable key from our web server so for that to work we will need to start up our web server here i'm using the node server and you can see it is now running on localhost 4242 if you want to learn how you initialize stripe.js in an html page and load the publisher key from your server you can watch the videos that are linked in the description below so here we're just fetching our config route and we will get back a publishable key and then we're just initializing stripe.js with our publishable key next we get a reference to our payment form and we just attach submit eventlistener but here in our case we don't actually want to submit the page so we say event prevent default and so now what we actually need to do is make a call to our server's backend to create a payment intent and get the client secret to then redirect off to the alipay payment page so let's do a fetch here so our route is create payment intent and then we will need to pass in some headers so we need to to uh send this as a post request to our web server uh we then need some headers specifically we need the uh content type type header and we need to send it as application json and then we also need to pass some data so we just uh stringify a json object here and send that as our body and so we need to specify our currency um i'm just running on a us stripe account here so i'm just going to use usd for this and then we also need to pass the payment method type so that our backend can create a payment intent for alipay usage and then lastly we need to transform our response into json and so when this resolves we will get some values back that we can destructure we get a response back that we can to structure here first of all we get an error let's rename that to backend error and then if things were successful we get a client secret great so now we are fetching our client secret here and so once we have uh the client secret uh first of all let's actually make sure that we don't have a back-end error so if we have a backend error we then just add a message and that is a helper function from our utils javascript and we just say backend error top message and then also if there was an error we actually want to abort our function here but otherwise we add a little message to say that we have our client secret and now we can actually get [Music] go on and redirect off to the alipay payment page so uh let's actually first get our name from the input so let's say and our name input has the id name and then um what we now want to do is we want to confirm the payment intent and that's what we do with um our client secret and then this will uh send us over to the alipay page so let's go ahead and call stripe and we have a method on stripe that's called confirm alipay payment and here we will need to pass in a couple of things first of all we need to pass in our client secret from above and then we can pass in some options and so we pass in here the payment method billing details so that's where we can send our name so here that is the name and we get the name from our input above and then we also need to provide a return url so confirm alipay payment when successful will actually redirect off to the alipay page and so what we can do here is let's just get our origin from the page where we are at the moment and then we return to alipay return dot html where we then check if the payment intent was successful and so here we get also an error we can maybe name that the stripe error so if there was an error then we want to also check this so we say if there was a stripe error then um we add a message so stripe error dot message and otherwise we will actually be redirected off to our page so maybe let's just say add message uh redirecting to alipay great let's give that a save and uh go back to our page and now when we hit the pay button we get the client secret was returned and now we're actually being redirected to alipay so we're running here in test mode so we actually see a stripe hosted test mode page uh but that's kind of all we need for validating that our page is actually working we see here the payment is for 19.99 us dollar with alipay and then we can simulate the test payment success and failure states so let's authorize the payment here and we get back to our alipay return and you can see here the payment intent id and the client secret are appended as well as the redirect status and so we can quickly look into our alipay return js so here what we're doing is just again we're fetching the publishable key and then using the client the payment intent client secret from our url we can then use stripe.js to retrieve the payment intent with the client secret and that's what we're doing here we're then checking the payment intent status for the payment intent id and so that's exactly the message you're seeing here the payment succeeded and then that will actually link you to your stripe dashboard great that's it that's all you need to start accepting alipay payments from your customers in china go ahead and watch some of the other videos that we have for example some of the actions that you need to take after a successful payment like listening and handling webhooks thanks for tuning in and see you

basic server-side implementation for accepting a one-time payment with a custom form if you're interested in a faster integration path using stripe hosted checkout head over to the checkout playlist in the stripe developer channel so the payment flow you'll see today for collecting a one-time payment has two steps first creating the payment intent on the server and second confirming the payment on the client using the client secret for the payment intent in this episode you'll learn how to add an endpoint to your server to create the payment intent so depending on whether you're using vanilla.js or react on the web or stripe ios or stripe android on mobile you can watch videos for those specific front-end implementations that will co that will pair with the code we implement here so rather than start from scratch we're going to jump start our server implementation using the developer office hours based sample so if you want to see how we go from zero to one check out the starter episode linked in the description you might also be interested in an episode about working with the stripe cli it's a handy tool for helping you build and test your stripe integration all right so from the terminal we're going to run stripe samples create developer office hours and we'll give this one an alias of tutorial we can now pick dot net and that'll download and scaffold a bare bones project with a simple client with some html and a server solution for us so in this episode we're going to spend all of our time in the server directory and in future episodes we'll implement those frontends to confirm payment so let's change into the server directory and open up server dot solution all right you'll see that it already contains a root route for rendering basic html using the use web root and passing in the path to the client-side code using an environment variable you notice it also has a skeleton already for the webhook endpoint now at a minimum we need to add one new server endpoint to create a payment intent that will later confirm on the front end let's stick with the same naming convention as the stripe docs and we'll name our route create payment intent this will be a post route as byron convention we're creating a new resource a payment intent so the logic in this route is very simple we'll create a payment intent using the stripe.net client library to make an api request to stripe initially we'll hard code and pass just the minimum required argument so amount and currency this amount value is denoted in the smallest denomination for a given currency so in this case sense we'll initialize an instance of the payment intent service with our client instance and then call create async to make the api call to stripe finally we need to return some json with only the client secret property of that newly created payment intent we'll fire up the server by pushing the play button here in the top left and then jump into a terminal to test with curl this is going to be a post request to localhost 4242 with an empty object in the request body notice the response is well-formed json and includes the client secret for the newly created payment intent so for this demo we actually want the client secret to be camel case rather than snake case in order to match some of our other server implementations and to match the client so in practice it doesn't matter either way and it doesn't matter what you name the property return to the client just as long as we're sending this client secret it should work so we'll need to create a model with newtonsoft json property attributes to override the name of the property to use camelcase we'll name the class create payment intent response let's test again okay that looks great and has a camel cased client secret property returning to our controller code let's talk about this api call for creating a payment intent again so there's more than two dozen optional parameters available for tailoring the payment experience for your customers one of those optional parameters is payment method types which takes a list of string for the payment method options you'd like to allow your customers to pay with now by default this is a list of string with just one entry and that's the word card making this payment intent only confirmable with card payment methods so in practice you could hard code a list of values for all the different payment method types you want to accept here but in this series you're going to learn how to accept a wide variety of payment method types so let's refactor our endpoint to accept some arguments by deserializing the json body we'll create a new class called create payment intent request so that we can use model binding and in this class we'll extract an argument for the payment method type and furthermore some payment method types only work with specific currencies so let's allow the currency to be passed from the client as well we'll wire up the model binding arguments to the controller action and pass those down to the options let's head back to the terminal and update our crow request to pass in the payment method type and the currency in the request body cool that works but if we try to pass aubex debit as our payment method type and we leave usd as the currency notice this fails in this case we get a big failure response with an error message explaining that au bex debit only works with australian dollars if we update our curl request and pass in aud the server responds with a client secret as expected now in the future we'll want to surface these failures in a nice format so that the front end can consistently parse and present those errors to customers so let's wrap the api call and try catch block and if there's a stripe exception thrown we'll respond with a 400 and follow the structure where the response has an error property pointing at an object with a string message this matches the shape returned directly from the stripe api for client-side calls so it'll make implementing error handling logic on the clients just a bit easier to reason about all right so after restarting and attempting to create a payment intent with an invalid combo of payment method type and currency we now see a well-formed error response so most payment method types complete payment asynchronously for some payments complete nearly instantly like cards but for others payments can take a few days or even more to complete due to the asynchronous nature of the way money flows through networks we highly recommend implementing webhooks to automate fulfillment so we have episodes all about how to set up your web hook handler let's update our webhook endpoint to simply print to the server log when payment intent events fire it's quite common to automate things like sending email notifications or updating your database or pulling from inventory printing shipping labels and more as part of your webhook handler also worth noting is that you could use a third-party tool like zapier or ift as a low or no code solution for handling web notifications for now we're going to simply check to see if the event type is one of payment intent doc created and print a simple status update from the terminal we'll test our new webhook logic with the stripe cli using the listen command stripe listen forms a direct connection from stripe to this locally running server so that when events happen on the demo stripe account they're going to be delivered to the development server without needing any tunneling software like ngrok the stripe listen command accepts a url to which events should be forwarded we're going to add this dash l so that we're using latest event or the latest version of the api when generating event objects now if we successfully create a new payment intent see in the server log that the payment intent was created and we can see in the logs for stripe listen that the payment intent event fired all right let's improve our log statement to include the ids of the event and the payment intent and the status of the payment intent when receiving these event types that start with payment intent dot an instance of the payment intent is available on event.data.object and here we're doing some casting so we have the right type of instance we'll restart the server and fire another test to confirm our improved log statement and now we see the id of the event the id of the payment intent and the status of the payment intent note that this payment intent was not created with a specific payment method so its statuses requires payment method we'll assign a new payment method when confirming on the front end again covered in a future episode so as we add support for more payment method types in the future it'll be interesting to see these status messages in the server logs and align those with what the customer sees and with the various states for payment intents so note that depending on which payment method types you plan to support and which automations you're looking to build you likely won't need to handle every single one of these event types so at this point the server is technically ready to add a front end however we'll add one last simple config route for fetching a publishable key so we don't need to hard code that on the front end this simple helper is purely for serving our publishable keys when receiving a get request to slash config this is a best practice when working with mobile clients so that if for some reason you need to roll your api keys the publishable key is not hard-coded into production mobile apps shipped to users that would require that all mobile users install an updated version of the app to get the new key all right so as a quick recap we added a new endpoint to create payment intents the api call to the create the payment intent passes the amount the currency and now the type of payment methods we want to allow and we also added some logging to the webhook handler for debugging and looking to the future when implementing application logic to automate fulfillment and finally we added a quick helper for returning the publishable key so that we don't have to hard code that in the mobile clients next we recommend heading over to one of the playlists that most closely fits your frontend

description you might also be interested in an episode about working with the stripe cli a handy tool for helping you build and test your stripe integration so from the terminal we're going to run stripe samples create developer office hours and we'll give this one an alias of tutorial now we can pick java and that'll download and scaffold a bare bones project with a simple server and client html file for us but in this episode we're going to spend all of our time in the server directory and then in future episodes we'll implement the front end to confirm so let's change into that server directory and open up server.java so it already contains a route for serving static html pages and a skeleton for the webhook endpoint now at a minimum we need one new server endpoint to create the payment intent that will later confirm on the front end this route will accept post requests as by convention we're creating a new resource we're creating a payment intent we'll stick with the same naming convention as the stripe docs and name our route create payment intent now the logic in this route is very simple we'll create a payment intent using stripe java's client library to make an api request to stripe initially we'll hard code and pass just the minimum required arguments so amount and currency and this amount value is denoted in the smallest possible denomination for a given currency so in this case sense and this params class comes from the com.stripe.param namespace in stripe java so we'll go import that next we'll make the api call to stripe and this could raise an exception so we'll need to wrap in a try catch so for now if there's an exception we'll print it to the console and return an empty string and we'll come back to this and clean it up in a bit now rather than return the json for the entire payment intent we actually just want to return some json with only the client secret property of the newly created payment intent we can either create a static class and build a response object and serialize but since this is such a small one property json object we can just create a hash map and then render that back with json all right let's jump into another terminal instance so we can package and start the server with mvn package and we're going to call java passing it the class path to this this jar file that has all the dependencies built in and the the class path to our our entry point of server next we'll experiment with the endpoint using curl to make a direct request to the payment intent endpoint this is going to be a post request to localhost 4242 with just an empty json object in the request body notice this response is well-formed json and includes the client secret for the newly created payment intent returning to our code let's talk about this api call for creating a payment intent so it turns out there's more than two dozen optional parameters available for tailoring the payment experience for your customers one of those optional parameters is payment method types which takes a list of string values for the payment method options you'd like to allow your customers to pay with now by default this is set to an array with just one argument and that's card making this payment intent only confirmable with the card payment method now in practice you could hard code a list of string values or keep calling add payment method type to add all the payment method types you want to accept here now in this series you're going to learn how to accept a wide variety of payment method types so let's refactor our endpoint to accept some arguments by deserializing the json in the request body so we'll create a static class that we're going to deserialize that request data into and we'll extract an argument for the payment method type and furthermore some payment method types only work with specific currencies so let's allow the currency to be passed from the client as well cool so we'll head back over to the terminal restart our server and update our curl request to pass in the payment method type in the currency in the request body great now that works but if we were to try to pass aubex debit as our payment method type and keep usd as the currency note that this fails in this case we see in the server log an error message explaining that au bex debit only works with australian dollars we didn't really get a good error response so in the future we're going to want to surface those failures in a nice format so that our front end can consistently parse and present errors to customers so let's render an error response with well-formed json in a failure case so we can import stripe exception from com.stripe.exception and then add a cache for stripe exception and render a user-friendly message like so in the case of a just generic exception we'll render back and we'll just sort of like convert that error or that exception into the string value and we'll keep that the shape of the response the same so this matches the shape returned directly from the stripe api for client-side calls so it'll make implementing our error handling logic on the clients just a little bit easier to reason about now after restarting our server and attempting to create a payment intent with an invalid combo of payment method type and currency we now see a well-formed json error response now most payment method types complete payment asynchronously for some payments completed nearly instantly like cards but for others payment can take a few days or even more to complete and due to the asynchronous nature of the way that money flows through networks we highly recommend implementing webhooks to automate fulfillment we have episodes all about how to set up your webhook handler so let's update this webhook endpoint to simply print to the server log when payment intent events fire it's quite common to automate things like email notifications updating your database pulling from inventory printing shipping labels and more as part of this webhook handler also worth noting that you could use a third-party tool like zapier or ift as a low or no code solution for handling web hook notifications for now we'll simply check to see if the event type is one of paymentintent.created and print a simple status update from the terminal we'll restart our server and then test our new webhook logic with the stripe cli using the listen command stripe listen forms a direct connection from stripe to this locally running server so that when events happen on the demo stripe account they're delivered to the development environment without needing any tunneling software like ngrok the stripe listen command accepts a url to which events should be forwarded now if we successfully create a new payment intent with ideal and euros we see in the server log that the payment intent was created and we can see in the logs for stripe listen that the payment intent created event fired let's improve our lock statement to include the ids of the event and the payment intent and the status of the payment intent we'll restart the server and fire another test to confirm our improved log statement now we see the id of the event the id of the payment intent and the status of the payment intent note that the payment intent was not created with a specific payment method so its statuses requires payment method we're going to assign a new payment method when confirming the payment on the front end again covered in a future episode all right so at this point the server is technically ready to add a front end however we'll add one last simple route for fetching a publishable key so that we don't need to hard code that on the front end this simple helper is purely for serving our publishable keys when receiving a get request to slash config this is the best practice when working with mobile clients so that if for some reason you need to roll your api keys the publishable key is not hardcoded into the production mobile apps shipped to users that would require that all mobile users install an updated version of the app just to get the new key so as a quick recap we added a new endpoint to create payment intents we the api call to create a payment intent passes the amount currency and the type of payment method we want to allow we also added some logging to the webhook handler for debugging and look into the future when implementing application logic to automate fulfillment and finally we added a quick helper route for returning the publishable key so that we don't have to hard code that in mobile clients next we recommend heading over to one of the playlists that most closely fits your front-end implementation you can sort of pick and choose between different payment method types and you can use the links in the description or head over to the stripe developers channel and take a look at those playlists thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next one

trigger your app to launch with specific context data and that's exactly what we want to do here for certain payment methods for example digital wallets like alipay or wechat pay in china you want to facilitate a so-called app to app redirect this means that your app opens the alipay or widget pay app on the user's phone for them to approve the payment in their wallet and once done they will be redirected back into your app where the stripe sdk handles the deep link to then show a success or failure message this app to app redirect is desirable because it's the fastest and most convenient way for your users to pay if you don't already have a custom url scheme for your app for example for deep links navigate to the info tab in your app target settings and select the url types at the bottom here now let's simply add one for the identifier we can assess a variable here bundle identifier and for the url scheme we simply said accept payment now ios will know to open your app for example when the alipay app redirects back to accept the payment with the specific url parameters now in the last step we need to provide the url to the stripe sdk which processes it and fires success or error handlers accordingly so your app can provide the necessary feedback to the user now in older ios versions you would put this in the app delegate or scene delegate handlers you can see in the stripe docs link below how to do that however when working with swift ui since ios version 14 we can use the convenient on open url handler on our main content view so that's here we can say on open url and then we just get our url and so now we've already have stripe imported here from the previous video if you haven't seen that that outlines how you import stripe load the publishable key and set the publishable key for the stripe sdk and so now here we can just have just let's say stripe handled so we have a method here that is stripe api and it's simply called handle url callback with and we put in the url now this simply returns whether this was a stripe specific url so if this was an url meant for stripe then stripe handled will be true and so in the other case basically if stripe handled is false then that means it was in fact not a stripe url and so that means this was not a scribe url so for example this was a deep link meant for your application uh and so just handle normally and then that's where you would put your r code for the deep linking in your app now that's it now we're all set to handle app to app redirects for digital wallet payments like alipay and wechatpad for details on how to implement these payment methods you can find the corresponding video in the description below thanks for tuning in and see you soon you\", metadata={'source':

properties can be expanded the api reference marks expandable properties with the expandable label we'll look at how to modify your requests to include properties from related objects properties from distantly related objects additional properties on all objects in a list and properties that aren't included by default in a response before we get started it's important to note that while expansion can speed up your integration by decreasing the number of api requests that you make expanding responses can impact the performance of a single request to keep requests fast try to limit the number of nested expansions on list requests and only expand objects that you're actually using in cases where you need information from a linked object you can retrieve that object in a second call using its id for example let's retrieve a customer for a particular checkout session this approach requires two api requests to access just one value if you need information from multiple linked objects each one would require a separate request which all adds to the latency and complexity of your application let's assume now that you want the customer's default payment method for invoices we can see from the logs that there were three api calls to determine the payment method the api has an expand feature that allows you to retrieve linked objects in a single call effectively replacing the object id with the properties and values of that object for example say you wanted to access details on a customer associated with a given checkout session you would retrieve the check-in session and pass the customer property to the expand array which tells tribe to include the entire customer object in the response if we look at the logs we can see that only one api request was made to expand multiple properties in one call add additional items to the expand array for example if you want to expand both the customer and the payment intent for a given checkout session you would pass the expand array with both the customer and payment intent strings now so you'd like to work with an object that's nested deeply across multiple linked resources for instance if you need to know the type of payment method that was used for a given checkout session you would first retrieve the checkout sessions payment intent then retrieve the intense linked payment method to get its type again this is the expensive approach looking at the logs we can see that there were multiple api requests to determine the payment method to optimize this you can reach the payment method by recursively expanding using dot notation in one call the logs show that we achieved the same result with just one api call expansions have a maximum depth of four levels meaning that an expand string can contain no more than four dot delimited properties when the api returns a list of objects you can use the keyword data to expand a given property on each object in that list for example say you need information about the

the payment method used so if you're following along you know that this is a bad approach and there must be a better way the logs clearly show the iteration and the calls to the api rather than looping through each payment intent in the list and retrieving the linked payment methods in separate calls you can expand all of the payment methods at once using the keyword data the list now includes a full payment method object on each payment intent and again the log shows us that we've saved a lot of api calls to retrieve the same required data in some cases resources have properties

how the stripe api version is defined and how the api evolves we'll look at how the api version is initially set on your account and what options you have for controlling the versions you use in your integration we'll also look at web hooks and how those interact with api versions the stripe api version is denoted by the date that that version of the api was released so for example march 14 2019 or august 27 2020 now as you're reading our docs or working on your integration you may encounter other version references these versions aren't stripe api versions and they're not something we're going to talk about during this video but before we go any further let's give them names so that we're all on the same page here are some of the types of versions we're not going to discuss today the v1 you may see in the endpoint path while this may change in the future all of our endpoints currently have the same v1 reference the version referenced in the stripe.js path at the time of this recording this stripe.js was on its third version lastly all of our client libraries have their own versioning stripe api evolves in two ways backwards compatible changes and backwards incompatible changes backwards compatible changes are changes you can take advantage of regardless of what api version you're currently on these might take the form of new properties on existing resources and in some cases new resources themselves a good example of this would be the prices object that we rolled out earlier backwards incompatible changes often happen when we change when we remove a property from a resource we change the type of that property or the behavior of that resource fundamentally changes in these cases you have to upgrade to that api version to take advantage of these changes a good example of this would be a change we made in february of 2019 where we dramatically changed how the accounts api behaved in connect by default all requests from your application will use the api version set on your account unless you or the client library you're using overrides that we recommend being explicit about what api version you're using this will allow you to better understand how you might have to upgrade your integration as we release new api versions with new features if you're using one of our libraries in a dynamically typed language such as ruby php python or node you can set the api version on a per request basis or globally if you're using one of our libraries in a statically typed language such as java go or dot net the api version is pinned to the version of the client library that you're using so let's take a look at how you can set the api version you're using when you're working with our ruby library in this example the stripe account i'm using is set to an older version of the api one from 2019 i'm going to create a customer on that on that account right now using that default version and then we'll take a look at how we can set the api to a later version and compare the responses of the calls so let's get started by creating a customer i have version.rb up here and we'll add a description then let's um run this and here's the customer we just created and you can see um that the response we got back is actually kind of long and i have to to scroll up to see the start of it so this includes a lot of information about the customer and it includes some extra hashes for example this hash that looks like that looks at the payment sources that are attached to the customer any subscriptions that are associated with the customer as well as some tax ids that the customer might have in 2020 in a later api version we actually streamlined this response and made it a lot more compact and and more readable by default so let's take a look now so let's make the same api call and set our api version to this later api version and compare the responses in our ruby library there's two ways of setting the api version the first is to set it as a global option so let's do that one so we'll keep the call there but just set set the api version on the library and so we're setting it to uh to a version now from august of 2020 and we'll just update the description so if we're looking at the logs on these calls so we can see how we created them okay we'll rerun this and we can see now that the um that we're the response we i got back from creating a customer is a lot more compact and and streamline with this new version now if we didn't want to set the api version for all of our requests in our in our ruby script another way we could set it on this request itself is as setting it as a header on the request so let's do that now or comment out the global option here and then we'll add uh add the api version as the header underscore let's go back in and run again per request all right re-running and here here again we get the response from the 2020 version but this time we've set the api version on the header of the request itself now because this um stripe because my stripe account is set to a 2019 version that is the version that's going to be used to generate any web hook um event payloads that will be sent to my endpoints even though i've sent um even though i created the account using the 2020 2020 version we can just look at what this looks like by pulling the most recent event that we created so let's get the most recent event and if we run this we'll see that even this is that uh the customer we just created uh setting the api version on the request but because my account is set to an older api version the response is going to be generated using that version now if i wanted to send webhook events that were configured with the with a newer api version one way i can do that is by setting the creating a new endpoint and setting the api version of the endpoint when i create it and i can do that either through the dashboard or programmatically so let's add that to our script here so we'll create a new webhook endpoint and we set the api version here and this tells tells us how to configure that the payload in the event what api to use we'll just give it um give it a url and then lastly we're just going to set it to only receive the event this uh associated with this call here customer created so we'll just we'll print that out after it's created and then we will create one last customer and take a look at what was sent to our endpoint in the dashboard okay let's run this okay we've created our customer and we've also created our endpoint up here and you can see the api version is set on the endpoint so let's take a look at this in our dashboard we can go over to our logs and if we click on our web hooks here under the developers section we can see the endpoint we created open that up um then it takes the customer created event type and then if we look at the web hook that was just sent to this endpoint we can see that this payload was generated with the 2020 api version and there's the customer object\", metadata={'source': 'PxMztPi6q6Q', 'title': 'Versioning with stripe-ruby', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 2582, 'thumbnail_url':

client library that you're using let's look at api versioning when you're working with the stripe go library now the stripe go library is strongly typed and each version of the library is pinned to a specific api version let's start by printing out the api version we're using today so we can do that by just printing out the api version constant and then let's run this and so uh for this example we're going to be using the api version from august 27 2020. now when webhook data is generated that the payload for those web events is generated based on the api version that your stripe account is set to and in this example my stripe account is actually set to a different version that it's set to one from 2019 and we can really see the differences between the two api versions if we were to create a customer using the library and using the 2020 api version and then taking a look at the payload for the event that is correspondingly generated so let's do that now so let's start by creating our customer and we'll set that email and short description generate a new customer using those params and then we'll print it out and we're going to use um we'll use a little json library here to help help with the formatting of the when we print it out on our terminal okay so let's um before we print this out though let's also grab uh at the same time we'll grab the event that was uh generated um when we made this call so the customer created event and we'll print that out as well so we can compare the two and we're going to set the filter just so that we only get the most recent event make a call to list those using those parameters list those events then we're going to do a similar thing here we'll grab the the json we'll format it format the results just a little nicer okay let's give this a shot oh undefined customer let's go take a look here line 22 oh right i forgot to change my dependencies up here so let's grab the customer one and uncomment the event as well okay fix that typo at line 25. and at line 28. and quote this the one here okay one more time there we go okay so let's take a look at what was returned to us we remember we got both a customer as well as the corresponding customer created event so if we scroll up here to the first response we can see the customer that was created from our call and we can see that um it's a fairly compact um compact response here we can see almost all of it right here so this is uh something that we actually changed between api versions and this was generated with the august 27 2020 api version but in prior api versions we returned more information about the customer when it was created and we decided uh in last year just to make that a little bit more compact and more readable so we can see we can really see the difference between the two responses if we look at the event data that we got from the customer created event here because that payload was generated using the 2019 version my account is set to and so here's the customer and you can see that we're getting a lot more information here that we weren't seeing in that other response for example the sources hash and subscriptions hash tax id now if if your stripe account isn't set to the api version that your library is using you're going to want to make sure to explicitly configure your webhook endpoint to receive events set using the library api version so let's go ahead and do that now and create a webhook endpoint using the 2020 api version then we'll create another customer and we'll take a look at the customer created event in our dashboard so go back here and we can comment out the event list code and now we'll create a webhook endpoint and you can do this either through the api or through the dashboard in in both cases set the api version when you create the object so we'll do it here endpoint params we'll define the params so we're going to set the the events we want to receive at this end point and we're going to limit it to just the customer created event that we're looking at and then we'll set the url that this endpoint will be at and we'll set the api version that should be used when generating the [Music] payloads okay this is straight let's try okay so those are our params then we'll create the endpoint and we'll um use this code here that we used earlier to print it out and then as a last step i'm going to just create a new customer okay let's give this a shot 39 need a comma there and then also i'll need to uncomment that but comment this one okay and so you can see the uh the endpoint object that was generated here and that it has an api version of 2020 from august 27th 2020. so let's now go over to our account dashboard and look at the customer created event uh that should have been generated when we created that last customer so we're going to the dashboard and we're going to the developer section of the dashboard and we're going to click on webhooks we can see the endpoint we just created here and if we click on that you can scroll down and see the customer created events that stripe tried to send to the to that webhook endpoint and if we open up the payload here we can see that this event now was created using the august 27 2020 api version and if we look at the customer object that was included here we can see that it has the format from that later api version\",

'2021-03-19 00:00:00', 'length': 802, 'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"good morning everyone my name is mike shaw i'm an integration engineer at stripe and i help merchants in europe integrate stripe so that might be building an e-commerce store a marketplace or an online booking engine using stripe so today what we're going to do is we're going to go through a video um kind of walking you through web development so what is html what is css what is javascript um why are they important in building web pages uh we're gonna build a simple web page something like you see here we're going to learn about apis what they are what they do and then we're going to integrate an api with this button we're going to integrate the stripe api so when you click this buy now button brings you to a checkout page to purchase something so looking forward to bringing you through the video uh we'll share a youtube video for those of you that don't have a keyboard and can't do coding right now so you can follow along at home and we'll share that alongside this okay so for those of you that want to follow along as we go through this you can go to glitch.com forward slash and the squiggly line it's called the tilde stripe dash ty dash 2021 and that will bring you to this page so what we're going to be using today for this code and exercise is this website glitch.com which is a in-browser development app so it allows you to write code in your browser and see the the code that you've written in terms of what it's what it's showing and it auto saves which which is great so you don't you won't lose anything so when you go to that that url you'll see this page which says show view source etc so if we click show here it'll show you kind of what that web page looks like so you can see there's a button uh some some text a picture and a button and the button currently does nothing that's what we're going to change today so in order to get a copy of this what you want to do is you want to click on this button here remix your own so go ahead and click that so what glitch is doing here it's spinning up a project for you to use and it'll give it a randomly generated name you see here and it'll load up the environment great so here we have the the environment with readme um usually in code repositories you'll see online there's a readme the readme kind of tells you what this code base is about so you can see here this is a transition year 2021 code base we have the goals what you need and a bit of advice on on using glitch so as i mentioned glitch is a development environment so we have a couple of different files here that i'm going to walk you through so first of all we have a public folder and as this is a web app public is essentially the files that are going to be served as your web page so the first file is the index.html html or hypertext markup language is a computer language which describes the kind of structure of a web page so what you see here is you see the head head usually isn't visible parts of it are visible to to someone so for instance title checkout 101 you'll see if i click show here in a new window i'll see up top here checkout 101 so that's the title in the head we have our css style sheets which we'll discuss in a minute we have some javascript libraries we'll discuss javascript in a minute again and then we have the body and in the body we have some different sections or divisions also called divs here so we have a couple of different divisions which just divide up the web page into different sections then we have a h2 which very similar to like word or google docs is a heading so this is a second biggest heading and it's the text just says a very nice teddy bear inside the that we have an image as well so the image has a source where is the picture coming from and a class we'll discuss class later finally we have a button the button has an id which will be useful for later to find where that button is on the page and some text so this html describes what is the structure on our web page essentially and when we go here you can see we have a text an image and a button but you'll notice that our image has a certain size our button has a color there's a font where does all of this come from so all of this comes from the style.css css stands for cascading style sheets this is the code that describes how does the web page actually look so html describes a structure but css describes how the web page looks so here we have a couple of different things such as like the margin the width how many pixels uh how wide is this going to be um we have um a thing called like display flex so that if you if you um scale so like minimize or change the size of your screen um the image will will change shape and we also have the dimensions of our image and the button this here is the button's color so if we wanted we could change the color we could also change the the font and we can change the size of the picture we'll get to that in a minute the final file here is script.js this is a javascript file so if you recall html describes the structure of the page css describes how that page looks javascript is rarely used for like what happens on that page when things happen so for instance we have a button on the page we're going to write some javascript in a while that when that button is clicked we're going to do something we're going to run some code so essentially those are the three different languages that are involved in web development we also have a server.js which is our web server because this is a web page it needs a web server to serve that web page when people visit so we're using a library called express here this is also javascript this is back-end javascript so we have front-end essentially all the web page which is visible to people so you can think of front end like an app a website anything that's visible that when you go and visit it back end are the services that provide that so a back end is kind of a server you kind of if you've watched any sort of tv shows you might see like rooms full of all these boxes with blinky lights essentially those are servers um this server.js serves up the web page so it says here take everything in the public folder and serve that as static content we won't get into static content here that's a bit of an advanced topic but you could look up on wikipedia on web pages and static content we also have a route here this is called a route it's forward slash checkout session so if we had to go to our web page and ty add four slash checkout session essentially this code block is gonna get executed we're gonna fill that out later the other things that are in the glitch environment here is a dot env file this has our key we'll discuss apis and keys later as well and then we have the readme which we discussed and a package.json which you can ignore for now so the next thing we're going to do is we're actually going to make some changes to the web page so if you recall i'll close that if you hit click show and in a new window it'll show your web page and and when you make changes to it that'll be updated so we're going to go ahead and make some changes we're going to change the text we're going to change the image and we're going to change the color of the button to give you an example of how the html and css files work so going back to glitch we can see here that the heading a very nice teddy bear here we're going to go ahead and change the text so you can change this to whatever you want i'm going to change this to a very good dog so that if i go back to my web page you can see has updated my web page so i now see a very good dog there but obviously this bear is not a dog so under assets glitch has some pictures that we can use i've already gone ahead and put a dog in there i'm going to use this but if you wanted to do something else you could click upload and upload anything so i'm going to take this dog you can see here i have this big url which has the file hosted on glitch.com i'm going to go ahead and copy that in index and html for the source of the image which tells glitch where is this image but i'm going to go ahead and paste that there now if i revisit my webpage you can see that i have a very squished dog and you can see the dog is probably a little bit fatter than he was in the original picture so why is that happening if you recall html describes the structure of the web page and css describes how that web page looks so because it's a lock thing the dog is kind of squished i'm going to go ahead and look at my css file so in my css file you'll see there's these different sections one is a star a body container a product product preview and product buy button if i go back to my html you'll see that my image has this thing called a class product preview class links to the css to help the css to identify for this image where in the css am i talking about it so sometimes in html you'll see people use class in order to identify in their css an individual thing that they're talking about when they're describing how it looks so let's look for product preview in css there it is great so we can see the product preview has a width and a height that's the same so it's a square well the doge isn't really a square so we're going to go ahead and change that the height i don't think it's height let's have a look no no that does not really look much better it's the width that we want there we go that looks a lot better the dog looks less squished and a little bit more regal so i'm i'm happy with that great the next thing we're going to do is we're going to change the button color and i don't particularly like that yellow so we're going to change it so the way that colors work in web development is by this funny kind of mixture of text and numbers here this is called hexadecimal we won't get into hexadecimal right now as that's a little bit complicated but one thing that you will find is there's a lot of tools online that can help you get the hexadecimal value of a particular color they're called color pickers so i'm going to go ahead here and just do a google search for a color picker so i can either use this here or this website w3schools has some pretty good content so you can see here i have a color picker i'm going to go ahead and pick i kind of like that green so i'm going to hit that green you can see here there's a couple of different things it's a rgb or red green blue value there's a couple of other different fields you can see lighter and darker and i picked this one i kind of like that so i'm going to go ahead and grab that that's the hex value there and i'm going to replace it here and visit my webpage and there you go my button is now the color that i've picked so you can see css is great for that you can define the colors the fonts a bunch of different things we didn't have time to get into css too much today but that's just a whirlwind tour in terms of like career paths in computer science there's engineers who build the the web pages javascript such like that but there's also designers who work with engineers to define how the website works and these can be called graphic designers ux or user experience designers so if this is something that you like that you think you could be interested in that could be a career path for you defining how usable a web page is what does it look like what colors on the web page it's quite a lucrative career path okay so we have our web page where we like it and the next thing we're going to do is we're going to add some code to do something when we click this button so what we want to happen when we click this button is we want it to redirect to checkout stripe power checkout and the way we're going to do that is we're going to use the stripe api so api stands for application programming interface it's a way for an application to tell other applications how to communicate with it as an example when you refresh your instagram feed uh on your app your phone sends a message to the instagram api asking it are there any new posts any new posts then they get returned and get shown on your phone almost every device we use in our daily life uses apis to communicate when we use an app to communicate with an api we usually send some piece of information that tells the api who we are so if you think of netflix their api would need to know who we are in order to know what shows to recommend to us to identify us most apis use what's called a key also known as a private or secret key when we log into an app the app then knows who we are and uses our key to communicate with the api to get new posts or recommended tv shows so we're going to go is we're going to sign up for stripe and use stripes api so you go to stripe.com and click sign in so we don't have a stripe account so we're gonna go ahead and sign up for one so in email you can pop in any old email here i'm going to use this one because i already have a stripe account but i want to show sorry to show you uh what the experience looks like and then we're going to need a password so you need a pretty strong password here and go ahead and click create account this may take a few minutes okay great so we're now in the striped dashboard so um stripe you can see here on the left has test mode which is important because we don't want to take real payments we just want to do a demo uh to show this um you're probably a little bit too young to sign up for a full stripe account today but uh you know once you're old enough you could sign up for a stripe account and if you have any cool ideas you can get paid for them but right now this is all we need so as we discussed apis need a key in order to identify um who you are so there are two types of keys at stripe there's a secret key which is used when you communicate with the stripe api to charge to essentially to move money so you should really keep this one secret this is the one that can get you uh let you charge cards so you can start to make money but can also get you paid out so for money arriving in your bank account there's also a publishable key which is used in the the javascript on your client side so in on your in your application to identify the account that's that's been interacted with they aren't secret and they they are publicly viewable we won't go too deep into publishable keys today so the first thing we need to do is we need to grab the secret key so go ahead and click this button reveal test key clicking on that will copy copy it and we're going to go ahead and put that in our m folder so paste that in there so as you recall the dot m folder is a folder that stores our environment variables so this is a file the way you can put your secret key so you can see here stripe secret key when we use that in our code it will resolve to to this value here which is our secret key we're also going to go ahead and grab that publishable key so the publishable key we're going to put in our javascript on the front end so again this publishable key isn't secret it just is used to identify the account that we're going to be using when we redirect to a strike checkout okay so the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to write the code to integrate with the stripe api so if you recall from our server.js so our backend code that's where we're going to talk to the stripe api under this checkout session root so what we're going to do here is we're going to make a call from our web server to call the stripe api using our secret key to create what's called a checkout session which is essentially redirect to a checkout to pay for something so um i'm going to type some code i'm probably going to have a couple of typos we're going to we're going to work on it as we go along and you can follow along um and probably what will happen is we may have to work through some bugs so uh codeine is a lot of trial and error um there's different ways to like figure out what went wrong so let's see how we go so the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to create a variable called session so const just tells this code javascript that it's a variable that we want to hang around and we don't want to change so it's a constant variable session and so here we're calling the stripe um sdk the software development kit which which abstracts so what that does for us is it calls the stripe api on behalf of us so here we can create a checkout session and the first things we need to pause it is a success url there so what we need to pass here is we need to pass the the url of our web application now this is going to be different for all of you so i'd recommend like going to your website just grabbing this copying that and pasting it in and then at the end here we're just going to put success next thing we need to do is we need to have a cancel url so if someone decides they don't want to purchase the very good dog and we're going to have cancel your review as well cancel and then we need to grab a couple of other things i'm actually going to just grab these and copy and paste and we'll talk about what they are great so what we've done here is we've added a couple of different parameters to this create call so this is going to create a checkout and we're telling it a couple of things here so we're saying when successful go to this url and if someone cancels go to that url we're only going to accept card payments it's a payment so that's what mode payment says and then this is line items you can think of these like line uh line items in a checkout so like what are the things you're purchasing so the first thing we have here is price and product data so this is telling us that this is a price for an individual product product is a very good dog here's its image and it costs this amount and that amount is in cents so if you think we work backwards so there so that would be a thousand euro we're purchasing which seems reasonable a price for a very good dog and we're only going to purchase one of them so we're going to go ahead and see if that call works so what we can do here is we can put a console.log and we can log out the session if you're interested in code and want to play around with that console.log is a way to like log to show you here we have this file called logs which tells us what's going on in our program so what's going to happen here is this is going to run it's going to create something and it's going to log the result what it creates so in order to get this code to run you'll recall that this route we have to go to that route or make a call to that route on our web application so we're going to add forward slash checkout session and hit enter now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to glitch and we're going to have a look in the logs so you can see here all this red means that we have an error in our logs this is a big part of coding sometimes you don't get things right and there's an error so the error says in order to use checkout you must first set an account or business name on your stripe account straightforward so we're going to go back to stripe here hip up top here and a new business and hit edit we're going to call this doveink ad name great let's see if that now works so we're going to go back to our website cancel that hit that again and have a look at our log oh there we go so you can see it's no longer red and we have this black code with this curly brackets and all these different things so that looks like what in web development would call an object so we're getting something back from the stripe api great that tells us that our code is working the next thing we did need to do now that we know the code is working is we need to return this so what's going to happen is our website is going to ask our backend the server.js file can you create a new checkout session so it's going to call this root that's going to call the stripe api creating a checkout session and then we need to return the id of the checkout session so we're going to change this console line here to response.json and we're going to go session id so what this line does is when this function is called we're going to return a response json is just a format and you can ignore that for now and if you want you can go to wikipedia and i'm sure there's an article for json that you can follow along but it's a little bit complicated for today we're just going to return the id of this checkout session so that we can uh render it in our front end so that part was probably a little bit complicated so we're going to give you a couple minutes to to just make sure you have this in case you want to follow along so again in the route we're writing some code here um so we're out what i'll do is i'll paste this in the readme so in in the readme you can go and grab these and and copy and paste them in but essentially we have a success url a cancel url the type of payment that we're going to do the fact that it's a payment line items which tells us what we're purchasing and then a response okay so now we're going to hop over to our script.js so in this front-end javascript file we have a couple of things here so here we search through the document and get the button by checkout so if you recall in our index.html our button had a id called checkout so that's all we're doing we're looking through through the document the html document to go get us that checkout button then we're attaching an event listener like on click event listener so essentially what's going to happen here is when that button is clicked this event listener is going to tell this javascript to run this function create checkout session so in here what we want to do is we need to call our web server to say hey we need a checkout session can you please give us one so we're gonna write some code to do that here so we're gonna use what's called a fetch and we're going to go to that root and and it's is a dot then so once that successfully returns [Music] this result so res oh sorry lots of typos and we're gonna get that json again you can ignore json for now once we get back that json which remember it will contain the session that we created then we're going to get a session id and what we're going to do with it is we're going to call stripes javascript library so starts front that lightly and we're going to say hey stripe then you redirect to check out that section right so what this code is going to do is it's going to fetch from our back-end checkout session it's gonna it's gonna get back the the json object uh read it and then it's gonna get the session id um and put a call stripe to redirect to that checkout so let's go ahead and see does that work oh i thought it wasn't going to work but there we go perfect so that did work so you can see we have redirected to stripe checkout.strive.com and see a picture of a dog looking at us it's a very good dog and it costs 1 000 euros so now because we have a checkout this is all hosted on stripe so this allows people to securely put in their credit card details take payments so if you think of a merchant a merchant wants to sell maybe dogs maybe clothes maybe food whatever it is they don't necessarily want to have to securely store credit card details um there's a lot of bad people out there that will love to like steal credit card details from your customers so merchants don't want to worry about that that's where stripe comes in stripe can let you um can store the credit card details for you and you can take payments essentially safely knowing that you don't have to worry that worry about storing those so we can go ahead and fill this out yes yes.com we're gonna fill out there's a number here just four two four two four two four two four two four two that's the test card from stripe we can fill out some date in the future um test test and we're coming from ireland so we're gonna go ahead and click pay great that was successful and now if you recall from our code we go back to our back end code we said on success we're going to go to our url forward slash success we did go to our url forward slash success but we have we don't have a page there yet so this is where we get in this error cannot get forward slash success so let's go ahead and build that page if you recall from earlier in the video we were editing the index.html which is gives us our web page when we go to our url and no forward slash such as livingwater.glitch.me would render the index.html so at the moment we're trying to get a success page so fortuna success but we don't have anything so the simplest way would be to make a success.html file so we're going to go ahead and do that a couple of lipos great so we're going to go and grab all of this there and we're going to paste it in here and then we're going to go back to our web page so this is refresh so we just know forward slash success okay it's still not working so why could that be so cannot get success ah i know why so here we're trying to get forge last success but actually the pages voice success.html we could change our backend so that when we go to a root for success it renders the the success.html page but that's going to be a little bit complicated for now so we're just going to do here is we're going to create this we're going to go success.html so that when we pay it goes to the success.html page so let's try that so let's fill this out again so this is our payment page at stripe we're gonna uh four two four two four two four two we can fill all this out fill out expiry date in the future cpc test and we're going to go ahead and pay that oh sorry there you go so this should great so we now have the success route working so we're hitting the right web page but it's just a copy of our index.html so we're going to go ahead and change things we no longer need a button because we've successfully purchased something so let us get rid of the button and if you recall here at h1 h2 h3 they're all headings kind of like word or google doc so we're going to create an h3 which is slightly smaller oh h3 which is slightly smaller than nh2 and we're going to go ahead and say thank you very much for your purchase and then we're going to go back to our web page i'm going to go ahead and go forward slash success.html get it to render that page and that's what we'll see when we successfully get a payment so that's great um and then on cancel when someone hits cancel so let's see what that looks like we hit buy now and then let's say someone goes oh go back okay it goes back to the chain checkout which is fine that's probably what we want we want people to go back to where they left off so yeah that's that's pretty much what we want so we'll run through this again so if we're on the page we hit buy that brings us call stripes api to create this which is called it checkout and we get back there the id we use the front-end library with that id to redirect our customer to strive to check out our customer fills out the checkouts they hit pay and we present them with a thank you page that's great so we built uh as part of this let's just go over what we built because that's that's pretty much everything that we needed so as a reminder we have our index.html we changed the heading we added a new image and we didn't do anything with the button however in our css we changed the shape of the image we added a new color to the button um and we added a new web page to say thanks when someone has purchased and in our front end javascript we added a publishable key we built a function which uses this uh what's called a method to to call our backend call the checkout session route and when we get a response back redirect to stripe in our backend code we built out the the code inside in this route so here we're using the stripe sdk or software development kit to call the stripe api and when we call the api we tell it some stuff about what we want so we said let's create a checkout session on success you're going to go to this url on cancel you're going to go to this url and you're going to take card payments and you're going to take a payment for this dog here's an image of it here's the amount here's the currency and the quantity um so yeah that's pretty much a whirlwind tour and as you can see we have a little little website that we that we can play around with um so i would recommend uh if if you found this interesting there's lots of interesting things that you can look at and there are some cool websites there's a website called codecadme and academy which has a couple of introductions to a couple of different things so let's have a look at some courses on code academy that i would recommend sorry let's see what to learn so we did some html today so there's a good one learn some html some of the functions we wrote on the front end and the back end we're in a language called javascript this is the course here to learn javascript this is a career path with front-end engineer so front-end engineer is an engineer that works probably on the front end of the client so um what someone sees so working on the front-end javascript working on things like making sure the buttons work that sort of stuff this is a bigger course 113 lessons probably a little bit much but some of these like learn ones are quite good um to to kind of dip your toe into into software development and there's a different couple of different ones here java is a back-end library probably a little bit hard but yeah so we did web development today a couple of different things you could look at it here um there is one somewhere that i did before for css which we spoke about but during css this one this one is is uh pretty good fun and it can teach you about like css about the colors typography all those different things that we spoke about and if you're interested in that interested in becoming maybe a graphic designer or a ux designer so i'd recommend codeacademy it's pretty cheap i think even you can have a look they might have some pricing for for students so you can get some stuff for free and there are some free free courses as well so this is where i would go next um some other things that may interest you there is a project called phaser uh bazer uses html and javascript to make games this is a little bit more complicated um i would probably like um spend a bit of time on codeacademy and looking at html and javascript before coming here but there are some good tutorials here and if you if you're interested in that you can learn how to make games so yeah um that's pretty much it for today and this video will be going up on youtube uh with some links um to the stuff that we spoke about throughout this video and um yeah if you're interested in any of this i'd recommend having a look at a career in um computer science whether that's uh in graphic design ux design uh front-end engineer back-end engineer computer science in general is a good option if you're not quite sure and you just want to explore um and like i mentioned there's lots online to to learn a little bit more before you make that decision so uh best of luck\", metadata={'source': 'rD8vbvul7ME', 'title': 'Stripe Checkout Example - Transition year workshop', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count':

episode we cover foundational topics and dig into the basics of using the java spark web framework how it works and how we use spark when creating video tutorials like this one and also in the stripe samples which is a collection of github repositories demonstrating integrations with many stripe products so you may be just getting started and are curious how to build an application from scratch to take your first online payment so if you already have a back-end set up and are comfortable adding new routes and are looking just to add a new stripe integration you might want to check out the other videos on this channel where we show how to integrate specific stripe products and features so why why spark the javaspark framework in its own words is a micro framework for creating web applications in kotlin and java 8 with minimal effort so it's simple and expressive and really built for productivity this allows us to keep the code for a demo concise while also showing a working example so if your app is written with a more feature-rich web framework like spring jsf gwt the same fundamentals are going to apply but you know it's going to be implemented a little differently across those bigger more opinionated code bases so it might be helpful to watch and refer to two other videos before watching this one first one about managing environment variables with java and the second being an introduction to the stripe cli so we'll have links in the description to these and other helpful resources so as a quick agenda for today we're going to cover how to set up a simple client with html we'll show you how to test out that stripe java is installed and that your api keys are working uh we'll talk about how to add a get route in a post route and you also learn how to set up a basic post route to use as your web hook handler so to start we're going to create a client and server directory the client will have a single html file and the server will contain our palm.xml and server.java so here we're going to make a new directory for the client and for the server we're going to use this big class path all right let's jump right in and add some basic html in index.html and we'll add some rough structure and just a helper css file in almost all stripe samples or video tutorials for the web we'll install stripe.js note that you always want to load stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com don't self-host this so in some cases we'll write frontend javascript directly in line to keep the content front and center in other cases we might use a script tag to just include a javascript file in our project so we're going to need an instance of the stripe object on the client in order to work with stripe.js which we can do by calling this constructor function and passing in our publishable key now after signing up for an account you can find your api keys in the stripe dashboard it's fine for purely web-based projects to hard code your publishable key directly on the client but if you're working with mobile applications it's recommended to fetch your publishable key from the server so that versions of your mobile application aren't tied to specific publishable keys just in case you need to roll those so as just an example for how to make a get request to fetch some data from the server we'll request the publishable key and then set it right here in a bit so we'll meet back here in a few minutes all right so let's turn to our back end and in this episode we'll manually create the project object model the palm.xml file and this file defines all the config for the build process and also where we'll manage dependencies if you're working with an ide like intellij or eclipse this palm.xml is typically managed for you when using the ui to like add dependencies and configure your project and give it a name and such but we're going to be editing this as text so we have full control and visibility into those changes all right so we'll start from this very minimal palm.xml file and we'll build up from here you'll notice that at the top of the file we see some basic config about the project with its name and version etc then a list of dependencies and finally some build configuration of note we'll specify the main class as server and configuration with a predefined plugin descriptor for with descriptor ref for jar with dependencies so that our jar output file has all of our dependencies built in now we can package our jar file with maven package but first we're going to need to implement a basic class with an entry point for running our app so let's open server.java and dive in we'll add a server class with a main function as our entry point here and just a little print statement okay let's build with maven package and try to run this so we're going to say java cp and then we're going to specify a target which is going to be this jar with dependencies and then we pass it the name of the class so com.stripe.sample.server cool all right so let's make sure that we can make api requests with stripe java by making a simple api call to list some products my demo account here already has several products set up in the stripe dashboard that will be returned from the api if this works we'll import stripe and a couple models that are required for fetching a list of products then set our api key and just make a get request to the stripe api using stripe java to fetch those products and we'll just print it out cool so let's repackage and again run the program to see the output awesome so we can see this json was returned from the stripe api so we know our api keys and stripe java are working as expected now in practice we don't want to hard code our api keys here so you might already have some credentials management tool for stripe samples and videos we tend to use dot end files for storing environment variables and managing api keys we have an episode all about managing environment variables with dot end and with java that we'll link to in the description now to load our api key from end we use a package called java.end so let's add that dependency to our palm.xml and then import it and now we can load the.n file with end.load and retrieve with dot end dot get now in order for this to work we actually need a dot end file in the server directory with the api keys so let's create one of those now and to start we're just going to add our secret and publishable keys now when you're working with stripe samples editing this dot n file and getting it set up is the biggest thing that trips people up so be sure this file exists it's called dot end and it has some good values populated there's typically a dot m dot example or dot end dot sample somewhere in the sample repository if we repackage and run the application that will confirm that our end file is working as expected and still hitting the stripe api with our secret keys again we're seeing some json back from stripe so things are looking good so let's add the spark web framework and get a basic server running so the way we use spark it has two dependencies one is spark core and the other is for logging so we'll add those to palm.xml and then import some very basic tools for spark so that we can just start with rendering some static assets so we're going to tell static files where to find the client-side code with index.html that we wrote earlier technically this client directory might differ a little depending on whether the sample is installed with git so just like git cloning the entire repository or with stripe cli so we tend to load this path from environment variables and again managing with dot end okay cool so next let's add a simple get route we'll need to import the get method from spark and that'll allow us to create a new route below with a call to get where we pass as the first argument the path and then as the second argument a lambda expression that will be executed as our callback when the server receives a get request to slash public keys technically we want to render some json back with publishable key when working with json we use google's json library for serializing and deserializing so first again we're going to need that to add that as a dependency to palm.xml and then import the top level json class and the serialized name annotation which allows us to specify when a member should be serialized to json with the provided name value as its field name this works also for deserializing so we'll use this when we create classes for serializing and deserializing requests and responses cool all right so next we're going to create a static instance of json client that we're going to use for serializing and deserializing these requests and responses and in our route we'll specify that the response type is application json and then we're just going to create a simple hash map with our publishable key and serialize that out as json for the for the response so we can test our endpoint with curl to confirm that it's running and is returning well form json okay cool so we can uh we can access this server data also from the front end now with javascript so let's head back over to the front end and we're going to use the browser's built-in fetch method for making an ajax request to this new endpoint so when using fetch to make a get request we can simply pass the path or the full url to which we want to send that request and it will return a promise that resolves with an object that has a json method which also in turn responds with a returns a promise that will ultimately resolve with the json object returned from the server so from the browser we can open the developer tools and look at the sources tab where we can see the frontend code that's actually executing i like to add breakpoints by clicking on a line number in the gutter and then hovering over various objects to see what their values are at various points you can use these buttons on the right here to step through or continue execution with that play button alright so this looks great and shows us how to make a get request from the browser back to our server next let's go add a new route to the server that'll accept post requests with data from the front end passed in from the front end so again we're going to use the same type of route this time it's going to be a post route so we're going to match on and pass in the path for accepting this post route and this is going to be create customer now most samples are going to pass json from the front end and that'll be deserialized into an object that we can more easily work with so let's create a static class which we'll deserialize into with json for now we're just going to keep the structure of the request very simple and just accept the email value in the json post body again this like serialized name attribute allows us to specify the value for the name property for the incoming or for the incoming json so we could name this email with a capital e or we could name it uh you know whatever if we want to use snake case or you know camel case here we could do that with serialized name next we're going to deserialize the request body into an object that we can print and work with okay poking at this endpoint with curl and making a post request with the email in the body of the request notice that the endpoint is just echoing back the request body so in practice this could be passing back an id for a newly created object or a database record or we could be creating a striped customer here and then storing its id in the database and replying with whatever you know the database records ideas all right so finally let's let's learn how to make this post request from the front end back to this api endpoint so that we can pass data collected from the customers to our server so we'll collect the email with an input and add a button for submitting the data let's grab reference to that button and add a click handler and what we want to do is when the button is clicked we want to send a post request again using this built-in fetch method available in the browser but this time we need to specify that it's a post request and we're sending application json now the data we're sending back is this json object where we can specify the value for the email like so so we're going to pull the email out of the email input and pass its value now when we click the button the email is passed to the server and we can see that jennyrosen.example.com in the alert and in the server log so to wrap up our basic sample we're going to add one more route for handling web hook notifications in this case we're receiving post requests directly from stripe so we have episodes all about how to work with web hook helpers so head over to the stripe developers channel to see those in action we'll start by referring directly to the stripe documentation here for web hook so we're going to go to stripe.com docs web hooks slash build and from here we'll copy the java snippet for webhooks and we'll just paste that into our our post our new post route which is going to accept post requests to slash webhooks and now we can talk through each of these bits so the first half of this function is basically to safely read in the request body and deserialize it into a stripe event object note that you could technically use the json instance here when creating we created earlier rather than the one that's on api resource if you wanted now each event has the same high level structure where we'll include some inner object and that inner object is going to vary based on the type of the event so because the underlying object could be a payment intent or a customer or really any type of stripe resource we need to further deserialize that raw inner json into some intermediate generic stripe object so that we can cast that into the specific stripe java model below that way we can access methods on the object itself and you know if the request was read successfully and the event was deserialized without error then we can sort of just like switch on the events type and automate logic for things like pulling from inventory sending customer emails printing shipping labels etc okay and then finally we respond with a 200 status code back to stripe all right so as a quick recap we scaffolded a basic html page showed how to serve some static files and exposed get and post routes from a spark server we also covered how to make get and post requests from the front end using the browser's built-in fetch command this is how the starter was built and how we build samples with java and the spark framework thanks so much for watching if

particularly useful for asynchronous events like when a customer's bank confirms a payment a customer disputes a charge on a card or a recurring payment succeeds as part of a subscription metaphorically a webhook endpoint is like a phone number that stripe calls to notify you of activity in your stripe account the activity could be the creation of a new customer or the payout of funds to your bank account an event is the specific phone call and your server is the person who takes actions based upon the specific information it receives the stripe notifications are event objects the event object contains all the relevant information about what just happened including the type of event and the data associated with that event the webwork endpoint uses the event details to take any required actions such as indicating an order should be fulfilled many events that occur within a stripe account are asynchronous meaning they happen at a later point in time and are not directly in response to your code's execution some examples a customer successfully completing the checkout session or a subscription is renewing or a payout is being paid to a connected account with these in similar apis rather than constantly polling for the status of an object you can allow stripe to notify your integration about changes to an object so that you can automate the subsequent steps when an event occurs on your stripe account a post request will be sent directly from stripe with a json payload the shape of that json payload depends on the api version of your account that is used to generate the event object we cover webhook endpoint versioning in an episode earlier in this playlist if you're curious about the specifics you can check out the link when your application receives a webhook notification there are two ways to deserialize the json from stripe into an object you can work with one simply deserializes and creates an instance of the correct class the other will both deserialize into an instance and also verify the webhook's signatures to ensure the payload did indeed come from stripe building and testing web books locally can be challenging for api integrations the stripe cli has a very handy command for forwarding events that fire on your stripe account to your local server alternatively you could publish your web hook to a public server or use a tunneling tool like ngrok for testing but we'll be using stripe listen with the stripe cli today and it is the tool that we recommend okay let's switch into our uh net app directory here and open up our project so we have uh just a bare bone basic dotnet mvc app and we just have one payments controller here we've called it and this uh payments controller really just has one http post method that it handles which is the webhook route and right now it just returns a 200 okay so uh in the first step let's just go ahead and make sure that our local webhook forwarding works and that our um webpack handler here is uh executed when an event fires and is forwarded locally um so let's just uh read that um into a json so let's just get a new stream reader here with the http context we can get the request body and then we just want to read to and async and just get kind of a raw uh request body in here uh and then let's just console um right line just put that on the console uh let's give that a save and um see what happens so in our console let's just net run and so now we can see we're now listening on localhost 4242 so that's exactly where we want to forward our webhook events too so with the stripe cli we can say stripe listen forward to localhost 4242 slash webhook is our route so let's start that up and so now the webhooks are being forwarded and uh the stripe cli is outputting here a webwork signing secret we'll use that later to verify the event but for now let's just trigger a customer dot created event and see what happens and now we can see we got um our json here from the event object just output it here great so now um we got the the json payload let's take a net next step and simply deserialize that json into a stripe event object and so we can use the event utility to pass the event from the striped.net library so let's go ahead and do that so we got our json and then we want the stripe event and so event utility you delete t and we can parse the event from the json and then maybe let's just console right line uh maybe just let's do the uh stripe event and then maybe the stripe event dot type uh get that out and then lastly we uh can cast so like every stripe event has a data object that it entails so in our case with the customer created event it is um a customer object and so um [Music] we can then check if the stripe event is of type so type events and so we have the customer created a constant here and if that is the case then we can actually get out the customer object from the stripe event so stripe event data dot object and we just cast that into a stripe customer object and then lastly maybe let's write here console.log as well the customer and maybe the customer id we also have that so now that we have a customer object we can say customer dot id okay let's give that a save and restart our.net server now our webhook forwarding is still on and so let's simply trigger another customer created event and so here we have it we can now see we have the stripe event object here and then as well as the uh event object type so that's the customer created and so then we are in our if statement and we've also extracted the customer object here and we got the customer id uh great and so the um event type here uh that is what you you know generally use to sort of write a switch uh statement to then handle uh all the different types of events that you want to handle in your application depending on your integration the automations you build in the weapon handler are likely performing sensitive actions like pulling from inventory shipping goods or provisioning access as such you'll want to ensure that the post requests to your endpoint were in fact from stripe and not a malicious user there are a few ways to secure your webhook endpoint one of which is called signature verification stripe signs the webhook events it sends to your webhook endpoints by including a signature in each post requests stripe signature header this allows you to verify that the events were sent by stripe and not by a third party while you can technically verify signatures manually by extracting the timestamp and signatures from the header then concatenating the timestamp the period and the raw request body computing the hmac with the sha 256 hash function and use the endpoint signing secret as the key and the sign payload string as the message and then compare that signature with the signature from the header but there are issues that we see when users are configuring webwork signature verification the most common is that the payload has been modified before the verification check happens often the request body is converted by some helpful middleware that ultimately changes the shape of the payload causing the verification to fail because the request body is now different and the resulting signatures do not match in order to avoid this i'll talk you through using the stripe client libraries to construct the event and verify the signature to do so we first need to create webhook endpoint objects which specifies the url to which stripe will post the event objects to creating the webport endpoint will also create the signing secret which will need to later verify the event you can create your webhook endpoint via the dashboard in the developer section select webhooks click add an endpoint let's say it's example.com webhook we can say that we want to receive all events but generally it's recommended to select just the events that you want to listen to so today we want to listen to the customer created event let's add the endpoint now we can see the details of our workbook endpoint we can see the api version that is used to construct the json payload we can see the event types and here this is what we'll need to verify the signature headers so let's click to reveal of course you want to handle this securely so don't ever show this uh your live secrets in a screen share alternatively you can create the webhook endpoint via the api we can use the stripe cli to fire off a request to create a webhook endpoint similar here we specify the url for our workbook and the events and the list of events that we want to enable and now we can see here's our webhook endpoint and the secret do note that the webwork secret is only returned in the creation request not in the get request to get the details or the update request so when you create the webhook via the webhook endpoint via the api make sure that you then securely store the webhook secret as part of the creation request when using the stripe cli you don't need to create a webhook endpoint yourself but rather the cli will create a special webhook endpoint for you and print the signing secret when you start the listen command you can also run stripe listen with the print secret parameter if you just want to get the secret it returns the webhook secret for you that you can then use for local testing with the stripe cli okay let's comment out the um simple deserialization uh here let's just say okay that was simple realization uh and now we want to look at the signature verification so uh when working with signature verification we need three pieces of data we need the raw request payload the uh signature and the signing secret now uh the payload again we've done this before we can get from the request body then uh we need the endpoint uh secret so uh when we're testing locally we can get that printed from the stripe cli do treat this like you know your secret api key uh it is a secret so do treat it as such and we have uh some videos on how to handle secrets in environment variables if you want to refer to that and then lastly we need the signature from the header so signature header and again we can get that from the request headers stripe signature great and so when we have these three pieces of information we can then uh construct the uh stripe event uh using the event uh utility and construct the event with um passing in the json the signature header and the endpoint secret there we are and then um if the signature verification fails here when constructing the event then this function will throw an error so we'll want to wrap this into a try catch really so let's just grab this whole thing to try and then we um just want to catch uh any stripe exception that might be there so let's say stripe exception e and then in that case we just write the error to the console and we want to return a bad request okay and then in our try block we'll just put in our code from before so now we got this all wrapped stripe event constructed maybe let's copy again um the right line from above just to make sure we get our secrets and all that works okay okay let's give that a save and restart our net server and let's restart our workbook forwarding and trigger another customer created event and we can see it has worked we've got the stripe event again it is a customer created event and so we also got the stripe customer object great so the signature verification is working now let's wrap this up by pretending we're a malicious party and just sending some random requests to the weboc handler so let's just send the post request to http slash localhost on port 4242 webhook and just send some empty payload and we can see now that um we've caught our error and the code hasn't executed so that's exactly what we wanted great great so now you've learned how to use the stripe cli to test your web book handlers locally and how to deserialize your event objects while at the same time verifying the stripe webhook signature thanks for tuning in to this stripe foundations episode see you next time\", metadata={'source': 'pQQH1bLVqjM', 'title': 'Webhook

increase the performance of your system by addressing the n plus one problem with api requests all objects in the stripe api have unique ids you can use these ids to retrieve update and delete these objects the api also uses these ids to link related objects together a checkout session for example links to a customer by the customer id not all properties can be expanded the api reference marks expandable properties with the expandable label we'll look at how to modify your requests to include properties from related objects properties from distantly related objects additional properties on all objects in a list and properties that aren't included by default in a response before we get started it's important to note that while expansion can speed up your integration by decreasing the number of api requests that you make expanding responses can impact the performance of a single request to keep requests fast try to limit the number of nested expansions on list requests and only expand objects that you're actually using in cases where you need information from a linked object you can retrieve that object in a second call using its id for example let's retrieve a customer for a particular checkout session this approach requires two api requests to access just one value if you need information from multiple linked objects each one would require a separate request which all adds to the latency and complexity of your application let's assume now that you want the customer's default payment method for invoices we can see from the logs that there were three api calls to determine the payment method the api has an expand feature that allows you to retrieve linked objects in a single call effectively replacing the object id with the properties and values of that object for example say you wanted to access details on a customer associated with a given checkout session you would retrieve the check-in session and pass the customer property to the expand array which tells tribe to include the entire customer object in the response if we look at the logs we can see that only one api request was made to expand multiple properties in one call add additional items to the expand array for example if you want to expand both the customer and the payment intent for a given checkout session you would pass the expand array with both the customer and payment intent strings now so you'd like to work with an object that's nested deeply across multiple linked resources for instance if you need to know the type of payment method that was used for a given checkout session you would first retrieve the checkout sessions payment intent then retrieve the intense linked payment method to get its type again this is the expensive approach looking at the logs we can see that there were multiple api requests to determine the payment method to optimize this you can reach the payment method by recursively expanding using dot notation in one call the logs show that we achieved the same result with just one api call expansions have a maximum depth of four levels meaning that an expand string can contain no more than four dot delimited properties when the api returns a list of objects you can use the keyword data to expand a given property on each object in that list for example say you need information about the payment methods used by one of your customers to get this information you would list the customer's payment intents then for each payment intent make another call to the api for each of those to get the payment method used so if you're following along you know that this is a bad approach and there must be a better way the logs clearly show the iteration and the calls to the api rather than looping through each payment intent in the list and retrieving the linked payment methods in separate calls you can expand all of the payment methods at once using the keyword data the list now includes a full payment method object on each payment intent and again the log shows us that we've saved a lot of api calls to retrieve the same required data in some cases resources have properties that aren't included by default one example is the checkout sessions line items property which is only included in responses if requested by using the expand parameter expansion isn't limited to get requests you can also specify an expansion array when creating or updating objects in the api you may for example want to create a payment intent with a customer id and receive the associated customer expanded in the response you one final parting thought you can't receive web hook events with properties auto expanded object sensing events are always in their minimal form to access nested values and expandable properties you must retrieve the

when creating or updating objects in the api you may for example want to create a payment intent with a customer id and receive the associated customer expanded in the response one final parting thought you can't receive web hook events with properties auto expanded object sensing events are always in their minimal form to access nested values and expandable properties you must retrieve the object in a separate api call from within your webhook event handler [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode on expansion and until next time stay safe [Music]\", metadata={'source':

you call the api what functionality you have access to and what you're guaranteed to get back as part of the response we've versioned the stripe api so that we can continue to release new features without breaking existing integrations or requiring developers to immediately upgrade in this video we're going to talk about how the stripe api version is defined and how the api evolves we'll look at how the api version is initially set on your account and what options you have for controlling the versions you use in your integration we'll also look at web hooks and how those interact with api versions the stripe api version is denoted by the date that that version of the api was released so for example march 14 2019 or august 27 2020 now as you're reading our docs or working on your integration you may encounter other version references these versions aren't stripe api versions and they're not something we're going to talk about during this video but before we go any further let's give them names so that we're all on the same page here are some of the types of versions we're not going to discuss today the v1 you may see in the endpoint path while this may change in the future all of our endpoints currently have the same v1 reference the version referenced in the stripe.js path at the time of this recording this stripe.js was on its third version lastly all of our client libraries have their own versioning stripe api evolves in two ways backwards compatible changes and backwards incompatible changes backwards compatible changes are changes you can take advantage of regardless of what api version you're currently on these might take the form of new properties on existing resources and in some cases new resources themselves a good example of this would be the prices object that we rolled out earlier backwards incompatible changes often happen when we change when we remove a property from a resource we change the type of that property or the behavior of that resource fundamentally changes in these cases you have to upgrade to that api version to take advantage of these changes a good example of this would be a change we made in february of 2019 where we dramatically changed how the accounts api behaved in connect by default all requests from your application will use the api version set on your account unless you or the client library you're using overrides that we recommend being explicit about what api version you're using this will allow you to better understand how you might have to upgrade your integration as we release new api versions with new features if you're using one of our libraries in a dynamically typed language such as ruby php python or node you can set the api version on a per request basis or globally if you're using one of our libraries in a statically typed language such as java go or dot net the api version is pinned to the version of the client library that you're using so let's take a look at how you can set the api version you're using when you're working with our ruby library in this example the stripe account i'm using is set to an older version of the api one from 2019 i'm going to create a customer on that on that account right now using that default version and then we'll take a look at how we can set the api to a later version and compare the responses of the calls so let's get started by creating a customer i have version.rb up here and we'll add a description then let's um run this and here's the customer we just created and you can see um that the response we got back is actually kind of long and i have to to scroll up to see the start of it so this includes a lot of information about the customer and it includes some extra hashes for example this hash that looks like that looks at the payment sources that are attached to the customer any subscriptions that are associated with the customer as well as some tax ids that the customer might have in 2020 in a later api version we actually streamlined this response and made it a lot more compact and and more readable by default so let's take a look now so let's make the same api call and set our api version to this later api version and compare the responses in our ruby library there's two ways of setting the api version the first is to set it as a global option so let's do that one so we'll keep the call there but just set set the api version on the library and so we're setting it to uh to a version now from august of 2020 and we'll just update the description so if we're looking at the logs on these calls so we can see how we created them okay we'll rerun this and we can see now that the um that we're the response we i got back from creating a customer is a lot more compact and and streamline with this new version now if we didn't want to set the api version for all of our requests in our in our ruby script another way we could set it on this request itself is as setting it as a header on the request so let's do that now or comment out the global option here and then we'll add uh add the api version as the header underscore let's go back in and run again per request all right re-running and here here again we get the response from the 2020 version but this time we've set the api version on the header of the request itself now because this um stripe because my stripe account is set to a 2019 version that is the version that's going to be used to generate any web hook um event payloads that will be sent to my endpoints even though i've sent um even though i created the account using the 2020 2020 version we can just look at what this looks like by pulling the most recent event that we created so let's get the most recent event and if we run this we'll see that even this is that uh the customer we just created uh setting the api version on the request but because my account is set to an older api version the response is going to be generated using that version now if i wanted to send webhook events that were configured with the with a newer api version one way i can do that is by setting the creating a new endpoint and setting the api version of the endpoint when i create it and i can do that either through the dashboard or programmatically so let's add that to our script here so we'll create a new webhook endpoint and we set the api version here and this tells tells us how to configure that the payload in the event what api to use we'll just give it um give it a url and then lastly we're just going to set it to only receive the event this uh associated with this call here customer created so we'll just we'll print that out after it's created and then we will create one last customer and take a look at what was sent to our endpoint in the dashboard okay let's run this okay we've created our customer and we've also created our endpoint up here and you can see the api version is set on the endpoint so let's take a look at this in our dashboard we can go over to our logs and if we click on our web hooks here under the developers section we can see the endpoint we created open that up um then it takes the customer created event type and then if we look at the web hook that was just sent to this endpoint we can see that this payload was generated with the 2020 api version and there's the customer object\", metadata={'source':

globally if you're using one of our libraries in a statically typed language such as java go or dot net the api version is pinned to the version of the client library that you're using let's look at api versioning when you're working with the stripe go library now the stripe go library is strongly typed and each version of the library is pinned to a specific api version let's start by printing out the api version we're using today so we can do that by just printing out the api version constant and then let's run this and so uh for this example we're going to be using the api version from august 27 2020. now when webhook data is generated that the payload for those web events is generated based on the api version that your stripe account is set to and in this example my stripe account is actually set to a different version that it's set to one from 2019 and we can really see the differences between the two api versions if we were to create a customer using the library and using the 2020 api version and then taking a look at the payload for the event that is correspondingly generated so let's do that now so let's start by creating our customer and we'll set that email and short description generate a new customer using those params and then we'll print it out and we're going to use um we'll use a little json library here to help help with the formatting of the when we print it out on our terminal okay so let's um before we print this out though let's also grab uh at the same time we'll grab the event that was uh generated um when we made this call so the customer created event and we'll print that out as well so we can compare the two and we're going to set the filter just so that we only get the most recent event make a call to list those using those parameters list those events then we're going to do a similar thing here we'll grab the the json we'll format it format the results just a little nicer okay let's give this a shot oh undefined customer let's go take a look here line 22 oh right i forgot to change my dependencies up here so let's grab the customer one and uncomment the event as well okay fix that typo at line 25. and at line 28. and quote this the one here okay one more time there we go okay so let's take a look at what was returned to us we remember we got both a customer as well as the corresponding customer created event so if we scroll up here to the first response we can see the customer that was created from our call and we can see that um it's a fairly compact um compact response here we can see almost all of it right here so this is uh something that we actually changed between api versions and this was generated with the august 27 2020 api version but in prior api versions we returned more information about the customer when it was created and we decided uh in last year just to make that a little bit more compact and more readable so we can see we can really see the difference between the two responses if we look at the event data that we got from the customer created event here because that payload was generated using the 2019 version my account is set to and so here's the customer and you can see that we're getting a lot more information here that we weren't seeing in that other response for example the sources hash and subscriptions hash tax id now if if your stripe account isn't set to the api version that your library is using you're going to want to make sure to explicitly configure your webhook endpoint to receive events set using the library api version so let's go ahead and do that now and create a webhook endpoint using the 2020 api version then we'll create another customer and we'll take a look at the customer created event in our dashboard so go back here and we can comment out the event list code and now we'll create a webhook endpoint and you can do this either through the api or through the dashboard in in both cases set the api version when you create the object so we'll do it here endpoint params we'll define the params so we're going to set the the events we want to receive at this end point and we're going to limit it to just the customer created event that we're looking at and then we'll set the url that this endpoint will be at and we'll set the api version that should be used when generating the [Music] payloads okay this is straight let's try okay so those are our params then we'll create the endpoint and we'll um use this code here that we used earlier to print it out and then as a last step i'm going to just create a new customer okay let's give this a shot 39 need a comma there and then also i'll need to uncomment that but comment this one okay and so you can see the uh the endpoint object that was generated here and that it has an api version of 2020 from august 27th 2020. so let's now go over to our account dashboard and look at the customer created event uh that should have been generated when we created that last customer so we're going to the dashboard and we're going to the developer section of the dashboard and we're going to click on webhooks we can see the endpoint we just created here and if we click on that you can scroll down and see the customer created events that stripe tried to send to the to that webhook endpoint and if we open up the payload here we can see that this event now was created using the august 27 2020 api version and if we look at the customer object that was included here we can see that it has the format from that later api version\", metadata={'source': 'mBrhFLWxAD8', 'title': 'Versioning with

Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"good morning everyone my name is mike shaw i'm an integration engineer at stripe and i help merchants in europe integrate stripe so that might be building an e-commerce store a marketplace or an online booking engine using stripe so today what we're going to do is we're going to go through a video um kind of walking you through web development so what is html what is css what is javascript um why are they important in building web pages uh we're gonna build a simple web page something like you see here we're going to learn about apis what they are what they do and then we're going to integrate an api with this button we're going to integrate the stripe api so when you click this buy now button brings you to a checkout page to purchase something so looking forward to bringing you through the video uh we'll share a youtube video for those of you that don't have a keyboard and can't do coding right now so you can follow along at home and we'll share that alongside this okay so for those of you that want to follow along as we go through this you can go to glitch.com forward slash and the squiggly line it's called the tilde stripe dash ty dash 2021 and that will bring you to this page so what we're going to be using today for this code and exercise is this website glitch.com which is a in-browser development app so it allows you to write code in your browser and see the the code that you've written in terms of what it's what it's showing and it auto saves which which is great so you don't you won't lose anything so when you go to that that url you'll see this page which says show view source etc so if we click show here it'll show you kind of what that web page looks like so you can see there's a button uh some some text a picture and a button and the button currently does nothing that's what we're going to change today so in order to get a copy of this what you want to do is you want to click on this button here remix your own so go ahead and click that so what glitch is doing here it's spinning up a project for you to use and it'll give it a randomly generated name you see here and it'll load up the environment great so here we have the the environment with readme um usually in code repositories you'll see online there's a readme the readme kind of tells you what this code base is about so you can see here this is a transition year 2021 code base we have the goals what you need and a bit of advice on on using glitch so as i mentioned glitch is a development environment so we have a couple of different files here that i'm going to walk you through so first of all we have a public folder and as this is a web app public is essentially the files that are going to be served as your web page so the first file is the index.html html or hypertext markup language is a computer language which describes the kind of structure of a web page so what you see here is you see the head head usually isn't visible parts of it are visible to to someone so for instance title checkout 101 you'll see if i click show here in a new window i'll see up top here checkout 101 so that's the title in the head we have our css style sheets which we'll discuss in a minute we have some javascript libraries we'll discuss javascript in a minute again and then we have the body and in the body we have some different sections or divisions also called divs here so we have a couple of different divisions which just divide up the web page into different sections then we have a h2 which very similar to like word or google docs is a heading so this is a second biggest heading and it's the text just says a very nice teddy bear inside the that we have an image as well so the image has a source where is the picture coming from and a class we'll discuss class later finally we have a button the button has an id which will be useful for later to find where that button is on the page and some text so this html describes what is the structure on our web page essentially and when we go here you can see we have a text an image and a button but you'll notice that our image has a certain size our button has a color there's a font where does all of this come from so all of this comes from the style.css css stands for cascading style sheets this is the code that describes how does the web page actually look so html describes a structure but css describes how the web page looks so here we have a couple of different things such as like the margin the width how many pixels uh how wide is this going to be um we have um a thing called like display flex so that if you if you um scale so like minimize or change the size of your screen um the image will will change shape and we also have the dimensions of our image and the button this here is the button's color so if we wanted we could change the color we could also change the the font and we can change the size of the picture we'll get to that in a minute the final file here is script.js this is a javascript file so if you recall html describes the structure of the page css describes how that page looks javascript is rarely used for like what happens on that page when things happen so for instance we have a button on the page we're going to write some javascript in a while that when that button is clicked we're going to do something we're going to run some code so essentially those are the three different languages that are involved in web development we also have a server.js which is our web server because this is a web page it needs a web server to serve that web page when people visit so we're using a library called express here this is also javascript this is back-end javascript so we have front-end essentially all the web page which is visible to people so you can think of front end like an app a website anything that's visible that when you go and visit it back end are the services that provide that so a back end is kind of a server you kind of if you've watched any sort of tv shows you might see like rooms full of all these boxes with blinky lights essentially those are servers um this server.js serves up the web page so it says here take everything in the public folder and serve that as static content we won't get into static content here that's a bit of an advanced topic but you could look up on wikipedia on web pages and static content we also have a route here this is called a route it's forward slash checkout session so if we had to go to our web page and ty add four slash checkout session essentially this code block is gonna get executed we're gonna fill that out later the other things that are in the glitch environment here is a dot env file this has our key we'll discuss apis and keys later as well and then we have the readme which we discussed and a package.json which you can ignore for now so the next thing we're going to do is we're actually going to make some changes to the web page so if you recall i'll close that if you hit click show and in a new window it'll show your web page and and when you make changes to it that'll be updated so we're going to go ahead and make some changes we're going to change the text we're going to change the image and we're going to change the color of the button to give you an example of how the html and css files work so going back to glitch we can see here that the heading a very nice teddy bear here we're going to go ahead and change the text so you can change this to whatever you want i'm going to change this to a very good dog so that if i go back to my web page you can see has updated my web page so i now see a very good dog there but obviously this bear is not a dog so under assets glitch has some pictures that we can use i've already gone ahead and put a dog in there i'm going to use this but if you wanted to do something else you could click upload and upload anything so i'm going to take this dog you can see here i have this big url which has the file hosted on glitch.com i'm going to go ahead and copy that in index and html for the source of the image which tells glitch where is this image but i'm going to go ahead and paste that there now if i revisit my webpage you can see that i have a very squished dog and you can see the dog is probably a little bit fatter than he was in the original picture so why is that happening if you recall html describes the structure of the web page and css describes how that web page looks so because it's a lock thing the dog is kind of squished i'm going to go ahead and look at my css file so in my css file you'll see there's these different sections one is a star a body container a product product preview and product buy button if i go back to my html you'll see that my image has this thing called a class product preview class links to the css to help the css to identify for this image where in the css am i talking about it so sometimes in html you'll see people use class in order to identify in their css an individual thing that they're talking about when they're describing how it looks so let's look for product preview in css there it is great so we can see the product preview has a width and a height that's the same so it's a square well the doge isn't really a square so we're going to go ahead and change that the height i don't think it's height let's have a look no no that does not really look much better it's the width that we want there we go that looks a lot better the dog looks less squished and a little bit more regal so i'm i'm happy with that great the next thing we're going to do is we're going to change the button color and i don't particularly like that yellow so we're going to change it so the way that colors work in web development is by this funny kind of mixture of text and numbers here this is called hexadecimal we won't get into hexadecimal right now as that's a little bit complicated but one thing that you will find is there's a lot of tools online that can help you get the hexadecimal value of a particular color they're called color pickers so i'm going to go ahead here and just do a google search for a color picker so i can either use this here or this website w3schools has some pretty good content so you can see here i have a color picker i'm going to go ahead and pick i kind of like that green so i'm going to hit that green you can see here there's a couple of different things it's a rgb or red green blue value there's a couple of other different fields you can see lighter and darker and i picked this one i kind of like that so i'm going to go ahead and grab that that's the hex value there and i'm going to replace it here and visit my webpage and there you go my button is now the color that i've picked so you can see css is great for that you can define the colors the fonts a bunch of different things we didn't have time to get into css too much today but that's just a whirlwind tour in terms of like career paths in computer science there's engineers who build the the web pages javascript such like that but there's also designers who work with engineers to define how the website works and these can be called graphic designers ux or user experience designers so if this is something that you like that you think you could be interested in that could be a career path for you defining how usable a web page is what does it look like what colors on the web page it's quite a lucrative career path okay so we have our web page where we like it and the next thing we're going to do is we're going to add some code to do something when we click this button so what we want to happen when we click this button is we want it to redirect to checkout stripe power checkout and the way we're going to do that is we're going to use the stripe api so api stands for application programming interface it's a way for an application to tell other applications how to communicate with it as an example when you refresh your instagram feed uh on your app your phone sends a message to the instagram api asking it are there any new posts any new posts then they get returned and get shown on your phone almost every device we use in our daily life uses apis to communicate when we use an app to communicate with an api we usually send some piece of information that tells the api who we are so if you think of netflix their api would need to know who we are in order to know what shows to recommend to us to identify us most apis use what's called a key also known as a private or secret key when we log into an app the app then knows who we are and uses our key to communicate with the api to get new posts or recommended tv shows so we're going to go is we're going to sign up for stripe and use stripes api so you go to stripe.com and click sign in so we don't have a stripe account so we're gonna go ahead and sign up for one so in email you can pop in any old email here i'm going to use this one because i already have a stripe account but i want to show sorry to show you uh what the experience looks like and then we're going to need a password so you need a pretty strong password here and go ahead and click create account this may take a few minutes okay great so we're now in the striped dashboard so um stripe you can see here on the left has test mode which is important because we don't want to take real payments we just want to do a demo uh to show this um you're probably a little bit too young to sign up for a full stripe account today but uh you know once you're old enough you could sign up for a stripe account and if you have any cool ideas you can get paid for them but right now this is all we need so as we discussed apis need a key in order to identify um who you are so there are two types of keys at stripe there's a secret key which is used when you communicate with the stripe api to charge to essentially to move money so you should really keep this one secret this is the one that can get you uh let you charge cards so you can start to make money but can also get you paid out so for money arriving in your bank account there's also a publishable key which is used in the the javascript on your client side so in on your in your application to identify the account that's that's been interacted with they aren't secret and they they are publicly viewable we won't go too deep into publishable keys today so the first thing we need to do is we need to grab the secret key so go ahead and click this button reveal test key clicking on that will copy copy it and we're going to go ahead and put that in our m folder so paste that in there so as you recall the dot m folder is a folder that stores our environment variables so this is a file the way you can put your secret key so you can see here stripe secret key when we use that in our code it will resolve to to this value here which is our secret key we're also going to go ahead and grab that publishable key so the publishable key we're going to put in our javascript on the front end so again this publishable key isn't secret it just is used to identify the account that we're going to be using when we redirect to a strike checkout okay so the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to write the code to integrate with the stripe api so if you recall from our server.js so our backend code that's where we're going to talk to the stripe api under this checkout session root so what we're going to do here is we're going to make a call from our web server to call the stripe api using our secret key to create what's called a checkout session which is essentially redirect to a checkout to pay for something so um i'm going to type some code i'm probably going to have a couple of typos we're going to we're going to work on it as we go along and you can follow along um and probably what will happen is we may have to work through some bugs so uh codeine is a lot of trial and error um there's different ways to like figure out what went wrong so let's see how we go so the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to create a variable called session so const just tells this code javascript that it's a variable that we want to hang around and we don't want to change so it's a constant variable session and so here we're calling the stripe um sdk the software development kit which which abstracts so what that does for us is it calls the stripe api on behalf of us so here we can create a checkout session and the first things we need to pause it is a success url there so what we need to pass here is we need to pass the the url of our web application now this is going to be different for all of you so i'd recommend like going to your website just grabbing this copying that and pasting it in and then at the end here we're just going to put success next thing we need to do is we need to have a cancel url so if someone decides they don't want to purchase the very good dog and we're going to have cancel your review as well cancel and then we need to grab a couple of other things i'm actually going to just grab these and copy and paste and we'll talk about what they are great so what we've done here is we've added a couple of different parameters to this create call so this is going to create a checkout and we're telling it a couple of things here so we're saying when successful go to this url and if someone cancels go to that url we're only going to accept card payments it's a payment so that's what mode payment says and then this is line items you can think of these like line uh line items in a checkout so like what are the things you're purchasing so the first thing we have here is price and product data so this is telling us that this is a price for an individual product product is a very good dog here's its image and it costs this amount and that amount is in cents so if you think we work backwards so there so that would be a thousand euro we're purchasing which seems reasonable a price for a very good dog and we're only going to purchase one of them so we're going to go ahead and see if that call works so what we can do here is we can put a console.log and we can log out the session if you're interested in code and want to play around with that console.log is a way to like log to show you here we have this file called logs which tells us what's going on in our program so what's going to happen here is this is going to run it's going to create something and it's going to log the result what it creates so in order to get this code to run you'll recall that this route we have to go to that route or make a call to that route on our web application so we're going to add forward slash checkout session and hit enter now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to glitch and we're going to have a look in the logs so you can see here all this red means that we have an error in our logs this is a big part of coding sometimes you don't get things right and there's an error so the error says in order to use checkout you must first set an account or business name on your stripe account straightforward so we're going to go back to stripe here hip up top here and a new business and hit edit we're going to call this doveink ad name great let's see if that now works so we're going to go back to our website cancel that hit that again and have a look at our log oh there we go so you can see it's no longer red and we have this black code with this curly brackets and all these different things so that looks like what in web development would call an object so we're getting something back from the stripe api great that tells us that our code is working the next thing we did need to do now that we know the code is working is we need to return this so what's going to happen is our website is going to ask our backend the server.js file can you create a new checkout session so it's going to call this root that's going to call the stripe api creating a checkout session and then we need to return the id of the checkout session so we're going to change this console line here to response.json and we're going to go session id so what this line does is when this function is called we're going to return a response json is just a format and you can ignore that for now and if you want you can go to wikipedia and i'm sure there's an article for json that you can follow along but it's a little bit complicated for today we're just going to return the id of this checkout session so that we can uh render it in our front end so that part was probably a little bit complicated so we're going to give you a couple minutes to to just make sure you have this in case you want to follow along so again in the route we're writing some code here um so we're out what i'll do is i'll paste this in the readme so in in the readme you can go and grab these and and copy and paste them in but essentially we have a success url a cancel url the type of payment that we're going to do the fact that it's a payment line items which tells us what we're purchasing and then a response okay so now we're going to hop over to our script.js so in this front-end javascript file we have a couple of things here so here we search through the document and get the button by checkout so if you recall in our index.html our button had a id called checkout so that's all we're doing we're looking through through the document the html document to go get us that checkout button then we're attaching an event listener like on click event listener so essentially what's going to happen here is when that button is clicked this event listener is going to tell this javascript to run this function create checkout session so in here what we want to do is we need to call our web server to say hey we need a checkout session can you please give us one so we're gonna write some code to do that here so we're gonna use what's called a fetch and we're going to go to that root and and it's is a dot then so once that successfully returns [Music] this result so res oh sorry lots of typos and we're gonna get that json again you can ignore json for now once we get back that json which remember it will contain the session that we created then we're going to get a session id and what we're going to do with it is we're going to call stripes javascript library so starts front that lightly and we're going to say hey stripe then you redirect to check out that section right so what this code is going to do is it's going to fetch from our back-end checkout session it's gonna it's gonna get back the the json object uh read it and then it's gonna get the session id um and put a call stripe to redirect to that checkout so let's go ahead and see does that work oh i thought it wasn't going to work but there we go perfect so that did work so you can see we have redirected to stripe checkout.strive.com and see a picture of a dog looking at us it's a very good dog and it costs 1 000 euros so now because we have a checkout this is all hosted on stripe so this allows people to securely put in their credit card details take payments so if you think of a merchant a merchant wants to sell maybe dogs maybe clothes maybe food whatever it is they don't necessarily want to have to securely store credit card details um there's a lot of bad people out there that will love to like steal credit card details from your customers so merchants don't want to worry about that that's where stripe comes in stripe can let you um can store the credit card details for you and you can take payments essentially safely knowing that you don't have to worry that worry about storing those so we can go ahead and fill this out yes yes.com we're gonna fill out there's a number here just four two four two four two four two four two four two that's the test card from stripe we can fill out some date in the future um test test and we're coming from ireland so we're gonna go ahead and click pay great that was successful and now if you recall from our code we go back to our back end code we said on success we're going to go to our url forward slash success we did go to our url forward slash success but we have we don't have a page there yet so this is where we get in this error cannot get forward slash success so let's go ahead and build that page if you recall from earlier in the video we were editing the index.html which is gives us our web page when we go to our url and no forward slash such as livingwater.glitch.me would render the index.html so at the moment we're trying to get a success page so fortuna success but we don't have anything so the simplest way would be to make a success.html file so we're going to go ahead and do that a couple of lipos great so we're going to go and grab all of this there and we're going to paste it in here and then we're going to go back to our web page so this is refresh so we just know forward slash success okay it's still not working so why could that be so cannot get success ah i know why so here we're trying to get forge last success but actually the pages voice success.html we could change our backend so that when we go to a root for success it renders the the success.html page but that's going to be a little bit complicated for now so we're just going to do here is we're going to create this we're going to go success.html so that when we pay it goes to the success.html page so let's try that so let's fill this out again so this is our payment page at stripe we're gonna uh four two four two four two four two we can fill all this out fill out expiry date in the future cpc test and we're going to go ahead and pay that oh sorry there you go so this should great so we now have the success route working so we're hitting the right web page but it's just a copy of our index.html so we're going to go ahead and change things we no longer need a button because we've successfully purchased something so let us get rid of the button and if you recall here at h1 h2 h3 they're all headings kind of like word or google doc so we're going to create an h3 which is slightly smaller oh h3 which is slightly smaller than nh2 and we're going to go ahead and say thank you very much for your purchase and then we're going to go back to our web page i'm going to go ahead and go forward slash success.html get it to render that page and that's what we'll see when we successfully get a payment so that's great um and then on cancel when someone hits cancel so let's see what that looks like we hit buy now and then let's say someone goes oh go back okay it goes back to the chain checkout which is fine that's probably what we want we want people to go back to where they left off so yeah that's that's pretty much what we want so we'll run through this again so if we're on the page we hit buy that brings us call stripes api to create this which is called it checkout and we get back there the id we use the front-end library with that id to redirect our customer to strive to check out our customer fills out the checkouts they hit pay and we present them with a thank you page that's great so we built uh as part of this let's just go over what we built because that's that's pretty much everything that we needed so as a reminder we have our index.html we changed the heading we added a new image and we didn't do anything with the button however in our css we changed the shape of the image we added a new color to the button um and we added a new web page to say thanks when someone has purchased and in our front end javascript we added a publishable key we built a function which uses this uh what's called a method to to call our backend call the checkout session route and when we get a response back redirect to stripe in our backend code we built out the the code inside in this route so here we're using the stripe sdk or software development kit to call the stripe api and when we call the api we tell it some stuff about what we want so we said let's create a checkout session on success you're going to go to this url on cancel you're going to go to this url and you're going to take card payments and you're going to take a payment for this dog here's an image of it here's the amount here's the currency and the quantity um so yeah that's pretty much a whirlwind tour and as you can see we have a little little website that we that we can play around with um so i would recommend uh if if you found this interesting there's lots of interesting things that you can look at and there are some cool websites there's a website called codecadme and academy which has a couple of introductions to a couple of different things so let's have a look at some courses on code academy that i would recommend sorry let's see what to learn so we did some html today so there's a good one learn some html some of the functions we wrote on the front end and the back end we're in a language called javascript this is the course here to learn javascript this is a career path with front-end engineer so front-end engineer is an engineer that works probably on the front end of the client so um what someone sees so working on the front-end javascript working on things like making sure the buttons work that sort of stuff this is a bigger course 113 lessons probably a little bit much but some of these like learn ones are quite good um to to kind of dip your toe into into software development and there's a different couple of different ones here java is a back-end library probably a little bit hard but yeah so we did web development today a couple of different things you could look at it here um there is one somewhere that i did before for css which we spoke about but during css this one this one is is uh pretty good fun and it can teach you about like css about the colors typography all those different things that we spoke about and if you're interested in that interested in becoming maybe a graphic designer or a ux designer so i'd recommend codeacademy it's pretty cheap i think even you can have a look they might have some pricing for for students so you can get some stuff for free and there are some free free courses as well so this is where i would go next um some other things that may interest you there is a project called phaser uh bazer uses html and javascript to make games this is a little bit more complicated um i would probably like um spend a bit of time on codeacademy and looking at html and javascript before coming here but there are some good tutorials here and if you if you're interested in that you can learn how to make games so yeah um that's pretty much it for today and this video will be going up on youtube uh with some links um to the stuff that we spoke about throughout this video and um yeah if you're interested in any of this i'd recommend having a look at a career in um computer science whether that's uh in graphic design ux design uh front-end engineer back-end engineer computer science in general is a good option if you're not quite sure and you just want to explore um and like i mentioned there's lots online to to learn a little bit more before you make that decision so uh best of luck\", metadata={'source':

'publish_date': '2021-03-16 00:00:00', 'length': 2319, 'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] in this episode we cover foundational topics and dig into the basics of using the java spark web framework how it works and how we use spark when creating video tutorials like this one and also in the stripe samples which is a collection of github repositories demonstrating integrations with many stripe products so you may be just getting started and are curious how to build an application from scratch to take your first online payment so if you already have a back-end set up and are comfortable adding new routes and are looking just to add a new stripe integration you might want to check out the other videos on this channel where we show how to integrate specific stripe products and features so why why spark the javaspark framework in its own words is a micro framework for creating web applications in kotlin and java 8 with minimal effort so it's simple and expressive and really built for productivity this allows us to keep the code for a demo concise while also showing a working example so if your app is written with a more feature-rich web framework like spring jsf gwt the same fundamentals are going to apply but you know it's going to be implemented a little differently across those bigger more opinionated code bases so it might be helpful to watch and refer to two other videos before watching this one first one about managing environment variables with java and the second being an introduction to the stripe cli so we'll have links in the description to these and other helpful resources so as a quick agenda for today we're going to cover how to set up a simple client with html we'll show you how to test out that stripe java is installed and that your api keys are working uh we'll talk about how to add a get route in a post route and you also learn how to set up a basic post route to use as your web hook handler so to start we're going to create a client and server directory the client will have a single html file and the server will contain our palm.xml and server.java so here we're going to make a new directory for the client and for the server we're going to use this big class path all right let's jump right in and add some basic html in index.html and we'll add some rough structure and just a helper css file in almost all stripe samples or video tutorials for the web we'll install stripe.js note that you always want to load stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com don't self-host this so in some cases we'll write frontend javascript directly in line to keep the content front and center in other cases we might use a script tag to just include a javascript file in our project so we're going to need an instance of the stripe object on the client in order to work with stripe.js which we can do by calling this constructor function and passing in our publishable key now after signing up for an account you can find your api keys in the stripe dashboard it's fine for purely web-based projects to hard code your publishable key directly on the client but if you're working with mobile applications it's recommended to fetch your publishable key from the server so that versions of your mobile application aren't tied to specific publishable keys just in case you need to roll those so as just an example for how to make a get request to fetch some data from the server we'll request the publishable key and then set it right here in a bit so we'll meet back here in a few minutes all right so let's turn to our back end and in this episode we'll manually create the project object model the palm.xml file and this file defines all the config for the build process and also where we'll manage dependencies if you're working with an ide like intellij or eclipse this palm.xml is typically managed for you when using the ui to like add dependencies and configure your project and give it a name and such but we're going to be editing this as text so we have full control and visibility into those changes all right so we'll start from this very minimal palm.xml file and we'll build up from here you'll notice that at the top of the file we see some basic config about the project with its name and version etc then a list of dependencies and finally some build configuration of note we'll specify the main class as server and configuration with a predefined plugin descriptor for with descriptor ref for jar with dependencies so that our jar output file has all of our dependencies built in now we can package our jar file with maven package but first we're going to need to implement a basic class with an entry point for running our app so let's open server.java and dive in we'll add a server class with a main function as our entry point here and just a little print statement okay let's build with maven package and try to run this so we're going to say java cp and then we're going to specify a target which is going to be this jar with dependencies and then we pass it the name of the class so com.stripe.sample.server cool all right so let's make sure that we can make api requests with stripe java by making a simple api call to list some products my demo account here already has several products set up in the stripe dashboard that will be returned from the api if this works we'll import stripe and a couple models that are required for fetching a list of products then set our api key and just make a get request to the stripe api using stripe java to fetch those products and we'll just print it out cool so let's repackage and again run the program to see the output awesome so we can see this json was returned from the stripe api so we know our api keys and stripe java are working as expected now in practice we don't want to hard code our api keys here so you might already have some credentials management tool for stripe samples and videos we tend to use dot end files for storing environment variables and managing api keys we have an episode all about managing environment variables with dot end and with java that we'll link to in the description now to load our api key from end we use a package called java.end so let's add that dependency to our palm.xml and then import it and now we can load the.n file with end.load and retrieve with dot end dot get now in order for this to work we actually need a dot end file in the server directory with the api keys so let's create one of those now and to start we're just going to add our secret and publishable keys now when you're working with stripe samples editing this dot n file and getting it set up is the biggest thing that trips people up so be sure this file exists it's called dot end and it has some good values populated there's typically a dot m dot example or dot end dot sample somewhere in the sample repository if we repackage and run the application that will confirm that our end file is working as expected and still hitting the stripe api with our secret keys again we're seeing some json back from stripe so things are looking good so let's add the spark web framework and get a basic server running so the way we use spark it has two dependencies one is spark core and the other is for logging so we'll add those to palm.xml and then import some very basic tools for spark so that we can just start with rendering some static assets so we're going to tell static files where to find the client-side code with index.html that we wrote earlier technically this client directory might differ a little depending on whether the sample is installed with git so just like git cloning the entire repository or with stripe cli so we tend to load this path from environment variables and again managing with dot end okay cool so next let's add a simple get route we'll need to import the get method from spark and that'll allow us to create a new route below with a call to get where we pass as the first argument the path and then as the second argument a lambda expression that will be executed as our callback when the server receives a get request to slash public keys technically we want to render some json back with publishable key when working with json we use google's json library for serializing and deserializing so first again we're going to need that to add that as a dependency to palm.xml and then import the top level json class and the serialized name annotation which allows us to specify when a member should be serialized to json with the provided name value as its field name this works also for deserializing so we'll use this when we create classes for serializing and deserializing requests and responses cool all right so next we're going to create a static instance of json client that we're going to use for serializing and deserializing these requests and responses and in our route we'll specify that the response type is application json and then we're just going to create a simple hash map with our publishable key and serialize that out as json for the for the response so we can test our endpoint with curl to confirm that it's running and is returning well form json okay cool so we can uh we can access this server data also from the front end now with javascript so let's head back over to the front end and we're going to use the browser's built-in fetch method for making an ajax request to this new endpoint so when using fetch to make a get request we can simply pass the path or the full url to which we want to send that request and it will return a promise that resolves with an object that has a json method which also in turn responds with a returns a promise that will ultimately resolve with the json object returned from the server so from the browser we can open the developer tools and look at the sources tab where we can see the frontend code that's actually executing i like to add breakpoints by clicking on a line number in the gutter and then hovering over various objects to see what their values are at various points you can use these buttons on the right here to step through or continue execution with that play button alright so this looks great and shows us how to make a get request from the browser back to our server next let's go add a new route to the server that'll accept post requests with data from the front end passed in from the front end so again we're going to use the same type of route this time it's going to be a post route so we're going to match on and pass in the path for accepting this post route and this is going to be create customer now most samples are going to pass json from the front end and that'll be deserialized into an object that we can more easily work with so let's create a static class which we'll deserialize into with json for now we're just going to keep the structure of the request very simple and just accept the email value in the json post body again this like serialized name attribute allows us to specify the value for the name property for the incoming or for the incoming json so we could name this email with a capital e or we could name it uh you know whatever if we want to use snake case or you know camel case here we could do that with serialized name next we're going to deserialize the request body into an object that we can print and work with okay poking at this endpoint with curl and making a post request with the email in the body of the request notice that the endpoint is just echoing back the request body so in practice this could be passing back an id for a newly created object or a database record or we could be creating a striped customer here and then storing its id in the database and replying with whatever you know the database records ideas all right so finally let's let's learn how to make this post request from the front end back to this api endpoint so that we can pass data collected from the customers to our server so we'll collect the email with an input and add a button for submitting the data let's grab reference to that button and add a click handler and what we want to do is when the button is clicked we want to send a post request again using this built-in fetch method available in the browser but this time we need to specify that it's a post request and we're sending application json now the data we're sending back is this json object where we can specify the value for the email like so so we're going to pull the email out of the email input and pass its value now when we click the button the email is passed to the server and we can see that jennyrosen.example.com in the alert and in the server log so to wrap up our basic sample we're going to add one more route for handling web hook notifications in this case we're receiving post requests directly from stripe so we have episodes all about how to work with web hook helpers so head over to the stripe developers channel to see those in action we'll start by referring directly to the stripe documentation here for web hook so we're going to go to stripe.com docs web hooks slash build and from here we'll copy the java snippet for webhooks and we'll just paste that into our our post our new post route which is going to accept post requests to slash webhooks and now we can talk through each of these bits so the first half of this function is basically to safely read in the request body and deserialize it into a stripe event object note that you could technically use the json instance here when creating we created earlier rather than the one that's on api resource if you wanted now each event has the same high level structure where we'll include some inner object and that inner object is going to vary based on the type of the event so because the underlying object could be a payment intent or a customer or really any type of stripe resource we need to further deserialize that raw inner json into some intermediate generic stripe object so that we can cast that into the specific stripe java model below that way we can access methods on the object itself and you know if the request was read successfully and the event was deserialized without error then we can sort of just like switch on the events type and automate logic for things like pulling from inventory sending customer emails printing shipping labels etc okay and then finally we respond with a 200 status code back to stripe all right so as a quick recap we scaffolded a basic html page showed how to serve some static files and exposed get and post routes from a spark server we also covered how to make get and post requests from the front end using the browser's built-in fetch command this is how the starter was built and how we build samples

application when an event happens in your account webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events like when a customer's bank confirms a payment a customer disputes a charge on a card or a recurring payment succeeds as part of a subscription metaphorically a webhook endpoint is like a phone number that stripe calls to notify you of activity in your stripe account the activity could be the creation of a new customer or the payout of funds to your bank account an event is the specific phone call and your server is the person who takes actions based upon the specific information it receives the stripe notifications are event objects the event object contains all the relevant information about what just happened including the type of event and the data associated with that event the webwork endpoint uses the event details to take any required actions such as indicating an order should be fulfilled many events that occur within a stripe account are asynchronous meaning they happen at a later point in time and are not directly in response to your code's execution some examples a customer successfully completing the checkout session or a subscription is renewing or a payout is being paid to a connected account with these in similar apis rather than constantly polling for the status of an object you can allow stripe to notify your integration about changes to an object so that you can automate the subsequent steps when an event occurs on your stripe account a post request will be sent directly from stripe with a json payload the shape of that json payload depends on the api version of your account that is used to generate the event object we cover webhook endpoint versioning in an episode earlier in this playlist if you're curious about the specifics you can check out the link when your application receives a webhook notification there are two ways to deserialize the json from stripe into an object you can work with one simply deserializes and creates an instance of the correct class the other will both deserialize into an instance and also verify the webhook's signatures to ensure the payload did indeed come from stripe building and testing web books locally can be challenging for api integrations the stripe cli has a very handy command for forwarding events that fire on your stripe account to your local server alternatively you could publish your web hook to a public server or use a tunneling tool like ngrok for testing but we'll be using stripe listen with the stripe cli today and it is the tool that we recommend okay let's switch into our uh net app directory here and open up our project so we have uh just a bare bone basic dotnet mvc app and we just have one payments controller here we've called it and this uh payments controller really just has one http post method that it handles which is the webhook route and right now it just returns a 200 okay so uh in the first step let's just go ahead and make sure that our local webhook forwarding works and that our um webpack handler here is uh executed when an event fires and is forwarded locally um so let's just uh read that um into a json so let's just get a new stream reader here with the http context we can get the request body and then we just want to read to and async and just get kind of a raw uh request body in here uh and then let's just console um right line just put that on the console uh let's give that a save and um see what happens so in our console let's just net run and so now we can see we're now listening on localhost 4242 so that's exactly where we want to forward our webhook events too so with the stripe cli we can say stripe listen forward to localhost 4242 slash webhook is our route so let's start that up and so now the webhooks are being forwarded and uh the stripe cli is outputting here a webwork signing secret we'll use that later to verify the event but for now let's just trigger a customer dot created event and see what happens and now we can see we got um our json here from the event object just output it here great so now um we got the the json payload let's take a net next step and simply deserialize that json into a stripe event object and so we can use the event utility to pass the event from the striped.net library so let's go ahead and do that so we got our json and then we want the stripe event and so event utility you delete t and we can parse the event from the json and then maybe let's just console right line uh maybe just let's do the uh stripe event and then maybe the stripe event dot type uh get that out and then lastly we uh can cast so like every stripe event has a data object that it entails so in our case with the customer created event it is um a customer object and so um [Music] we can then check if the stripe event is of type so type events and so we have the customer created a constant here and if that is the case then we can actually get out the customer object from the stripe event so stripe event data dot object and we just cast that into a stripe customer object and then lastly maybe let's write here console.log as well the customer and maybe the customer id we also have that so now that we have a customer object we can say customer dot id okay let's give that a save and restart our.net server now our webhook forwarding is still on and so let's simply trigger another customer created event and so here we have it we can now see we have the stripe event object here and then as well as the uh event object type so that's the customer created and so then we are in our if statement and we've also extracted the customer object here and we got the customer id uh great and so the um event type here uh that is what you you know generally use to sort of write a switch uh statement to then handle uh all the different types of events that you want to handle in your application depending on your integration the automations you build in the weapon handler are likely performing sensitive actions like pulling from inventory shipping goods or provisioning access as such you'll want to ensure that the post requests to your endpoint were in fact from stripe and not a malicious user there are a few ways to secure your webhook endpoint one of which is called signature verification stripe signs the webhook events it sends to your webhook endpoints by including a signature in each post requests stripe signature header this allows you to verify that the events were sent by stripe and not by a third party while you can technically verify signatures manually by extracting the timestamp and signatures from the header then concatenating the timestamp the period and the raw request body computing the hmac with the sha 256 hash function and use the endpoint signing secret as the key and the sign payload string as the message and then compare that signature with the signature from the header but there are issues that we see when users are configuring webwork signature verification the most common is that the payload has been modified before the verification check happens often the request body is converted by some helpful middleware that ultimately changes the shape of the payload causing the verification to fail because the request body is now different and the resulting signatures do not match in order to avoid this i'll talk you through using the stripe client libraries to construct the event and verify the signature to do so we first need to create webhook endpoint objects which specifies the url to which stripe will post the event objects to creating the webport endpoint will also create the signing secret which will need to later verify the event you can create your webhook endpoint via the dashboard in the developer section select webhooks click add an endpoint let's say it's example.com webhook we can say that we want to receive all events but generally it's recommended to select just the events that you want to listen to so today we want to listen to the customer created event let's add the endpoint now we can see the details of our workbook endpoint we can see the api version that is used to construct the json payload we can see the event types and here this is what we'll need to verify the signature headers so let's click to reveal of course you want to handle this securely so don't ever show this uh your live secrets in a screen share alternatively you can create the webhook endpoint via the api we can use the stripe cli to fire off a request to create a webhook endpoint similar here we specify the url for our workbook and the events and the list of events that we want to enable and now we can see here's our webhook endpoint and the secret do note that the webwork secret is only returned in the creation request not in the get request to get the details or the update request so when you create the webhook via the webhook endpoint via the api make sure that you then securely store the webhook secret as part of the creation request when using the stripe cli you don't need to create a webhook endpoint yourself but rather the cli will create a special webhook endpoint for you and print the signing secret when you start the listen command you can also run stripe listen with the print secret parameter if you just want to get the secret it returns the webhook secret for you that you can then use for local testing with the stripe cli okay let's comment out the um simple deserialization uh here let's just say okay that was simple realization uh and now we want to look at the signature verification so uh when working with signature verification we need three pieces of data we need the raw request payload the uh signature and the signing secret now uh the payload again we've done this before we can get from the request body then uh we need the endpoint uh secret so uh when we're testing locally we can get that printed from the stripe cli do treat this like you know your secret api key uh it is a secret so do treat it as such and we have uh some videos on how to handle secrets in environment variables if you want to refer to that and then lastly we need the signature from the header so signature header and again we can get that from the request headers stripe signature great and so when we have these three pieces of information we can then uh construct the uh stripe event uh using the event uh utility and construct the event with um passing in the json the signature header and the endpoint secret there we are and then um if the signature verification fails here when constructing the event then this function will throw an error so we'll want to wrap this into a try catch really so let's just grab this whole thing to try and then we um just want to catch uh any stripe exception that might be there so let's say stripe exception e and then in that case we just write the error to the console and we want to return a bad request okay and then in our try block we'll just put in our code from before so now we got this all wrapped stripe event constructed maybe let's copy again um the right line from above just to make sure we get our secrets and all that works okay okay let's give that a save and restart our net server and let's restart our workbook forwarding and trigger another customer created event and we can see it has worked we've got the stripe event again it is a customer created event and so we also got the stripe customer object great so the signature verification is working now let's wrap this up by pretending we're a malicious party and just sending some random requests to the weboc handler so let's just send the post request to http slash localhost on port 4242 webhook and just send some empty payload and we can see now that um we've caught our error and the code hasn't executed so that's exactly what we wanted great great so now you've learned how to use the stripe cli to test your web book handlers locally and how to deserialize your event objects while at the same time verifying the stripe webhook signature thanks for tuning in to this stripe foundations episode see you next

automatically retrying transient failures let's review item potency first the api supports item potency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice this is useful when an api call is disrupted in transit and you don't receive a response for instance if a request to create a payment does not respond for example due to a network connection error you can retry that request with the same item potency key and be guaranteed that no more than one payment will be created stripe site impotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given item potency key regardless of whether it succeeded or failed subsequent requests with the same key in parameters will return the same result including 500 errors i'd like to point out that if you do receive a 500 because of an issue on stripe side passing the same item potency key will also result in the same 500 being returned even after the issue has been resolved all post requests accept item potency keys but sending item potency keys for get and delete requests has no effect and should be avoided as these requests are ident by definition to perform a light important request we simply provide an additional item potency value to the request options so let's see how we can program some wide important requests first let's set our api key next let's create a customer using a lighting potency key now let's make that very same request again and check what's happened in the dashboard if we look at the request logs we can see that the last two requests were made with the same item potency key the second request however points to the original request on the list of customers we can see that only one customer was created even though i made that request twice we recommend creating v4 uuids or other random strings with enough entropy to avoid collisions with previously used keys the google uid module is great for this so let's check that out first let's create a uuid and now let's print that out when i run the script i get a universally unique id that i can use as an identity key it should be noted that you should only generate one key per repeatable request in order for the request to be identified as idempotent placing this code directly in the customer creation code we saw earlier for example would defeat the purpose as a new key would be generated on every execution let's talk about retries if an intermittent error occurs like a network error clients are usually left in a state where they don't know whether or not the server received and processed their request to get a definitive answer the client should retry such requests with the same item potency key most client libraries can generate item potency keys and retry requests automatically with an exponential back off the stripe go library enables automatic retries related to transient failures by setting the max number of network retries by default you can configure the number like so first let's add the network retries configuration now let's create a client and code to create a customer and now let's make that request if we look at the api logs in the dashboard we can see that the key was automatically added to the request had the client received an indeterminate response due to a network error the client will automatically retry the request and will receive their correct response as it was originally returned by the api\", metadata={'source': 'sUkZnCvmQ8g', 'title': 'Idempotency and retries in stripe-go', 'description': 'Unknown',

'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] an environment variable is a mechanism that you can use to set a custom value and then use that value later to change the way a running process behaves so their data usually changes pretty infrequently and the application is going to treat them like constants rather than mutable variables you could think of these as things that you would consider hard coding but would rather keep the value out of your code because either it changes between environments or because hard coding the value would leak some sensitive information like your API keys so there's a couple common use cases for environment variables you may have heard of you've got execution modes domain names API keys that path variable that you're used to seeing so for API keys this is really the core use case when using environment variables for a stripe integration because exposing your secret keys can lead to a bad day so rather than hard coding your stripe API keys right in your code it's better to keep them in some sort of environment variable and even better if that file is secure encrypted and really only accessible to those who should have access to your full stripe accountant all right let's take a look at how we can interact with environment variables directly in our terminal so we can do things like set an environment variable by saying export X equals 1 to 3 and then echoing that back dollar X that's how we access the environment variable directly in our shell now we might also have a file called something like dot in environment variables that looks something like this where we have settings where we can say setting equals value and if we source that file in bash then those environment variables will be available to us so often times in your bash RC or your bash profile you'll be modifying environment variables that you want to be loaded every time a new bash session starts so how does this pertain to stripe so we use a pattern within stripe samples and with developer office hours where we create . --an file and then we use a suite of tools and libraries that allow us to import and merge those environment variables that are stored in the dot and file with those that are globally available on our machines so we can create a dot end file here and set maybe we have our stripe secret key stripe publishable key and then maybe like a demo variable abc123 okay and we're gonna go through in in the language of your choice and we will load these environment variables with the dot end packages and see how to use them within our programs all right let's take a look at how we use environment variables within the stripe samples so we head over to github and check out all of these different stripe samples which are pre-built integrations on how to that demonstrate how to build stripe stripe integrations for different products and different scenarios so if we look at this setup subscriptions stripe sample you'll notice that in the root of the project there's a dot n dot example file this dot n dot example is a template for your dot n file which will hold your your API keys and some other settings that are applicable to the sample so let's clone down this sample and take a look at where the environment variables are set so that you can go in and set up your own when working with stripe samples so you'll notice that in the root we still have this dot m dot example and we expect that that's going to be dropped into one of the server directories so I'm going to go into dot Ruby and add a dot N file or I'm sorry into the Ruby directory in the server in the server directory and add a dot n file so we want to look at the example and we want to make sure that our server matches the the keys match this the same names so I'm going to copy those over so now we have a dot end file that has our striped publishable key and we have a stripe secret key and a webhook secret might be for handling web hooks and you might have you might also have a stripe plane NID happen to have one called movies and so that's how you modify the dot end file so if we change directories into the server directory and start the Ruby server with Ruby that server dot RB that will start up a new server at localhost for two for two that we can navigate to and now our our API keys are going to be used when working with this demo all right let's check out how we can use environment variables with PHP today we're going to be using composer to install a dependency called V Lucas PHP ends so we say composer require v lucas PHP and PHP inv is going to allow us to load environment variables from a local file called dot end and merge those with the globally available environment variables that are in our environment so the way this works is we we sort of initialize an instance of dot n when we load and then we can call dot n I'm sorry just get n which is the the underlying PHP method to get environment variables and we'll note that because we're using dot end we can use environment variables that are both globally available and those from the file so let's just create a new file called PHP demo no let's call it demo dot PHP and in here we're gonna say PHP and then we need to require vendor auto load it almost did it for me ok and then we're gonna say we're gonna create a new instance of dot in and this is dot in dot and and we say create immutable and we pass it in this current directory okay so that's gonna create an instance of dot ends and when we call load it's going to load up the environment variables from that dot n file so now we can do things like print out get in with the name of the environment variable so if we pull up our dot n file here we can see that the name of the environment variable the first one we want to print out is stripe secret so we can say stripe secret not publishable stripe secret okay and maybe we also want to say like this is the secret and let's also print out X to show you that X is not defined in dot n but it was one it was something that we exported globally directly from our bash session so here we have echo X with the environment variable X and secret with the environment variable that's loaded from dot end directly here in this file so now if we say PHP demo dot PHP we get it's not it's not printing pretty but we can see X and its value 1 2 3 and then secret and then SK test so if we if we cat in we see that stripe secret was this SK test 1 2 3 SK test 1 2 3 and we don't have X in here because that was merged from a globally available environment variable called X so that's X 1 2 3 all right so that's how we use environment variables with PHP the most common use case again is going to be setting your API key when you are initializing stripe PHP alright hopefully you found this useful we'll see you next time you\", metadata={'source': 'qAkxQIYHlUw', 'title': 'Environment Variables .env with PHP', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count':

the stripe api uses bearer authentication also called token authentication when making an api call you'll pass one of your api keys in the authorization http header with the value bearer and then a space and then your api key there's a few different types of api keys we've got publishable secret but there's also the lesser known restricted keys and also the somewhat related web hook signing secrets each type works with different permissions and use cases you can find or create these keys in your stripe dashboard publishable or public keys are used for making api requests to stripe directly from the front end these keys are used with stripe.js and mobile clients like stripe ios and stripe android these are very limited in scope because they are often visible in your client-side code so on the other hand we have these secret keys which are used to make api calls from your server to the stripe api and secret keys are never visible to the end user it should never be used with client-side code or shipped with mobile apps so your publishable and secret keys are going to be the most common most commonly used your api keys carry many privileges so be sure to keep them secure don't share your secret api keys in publicly accessible places like github or frontend code or you know any other place where users or people that you don't want having access to your stripe account might see two other types of keys that you might encounter are these restricted keys in web hook signing secrets so the restricted key is similar to a secret key however they provide you greater security by allowing you more granular control over which actions can be performed for specific resources so for instance you can create a restricted key which allows only the reading of the list of customers and you can use that api key to retrieve customers webhook signing secrets are used on the server to verify that webhook payloads did indeed come from stripe it's very specialized key so each of these api key types is a string that begins with the prefixes shown and ends with a random string of letters and numbers so pk underscore for publishable key sk underscore for secret key rk underscore for restricted key and wh sec underscore for web webhook signing secrets now when you're working with payments it's critical to make sure your integration works as expected and so stripe provides a test mode and several test card numbers to trigger different flows in your integration and ensure they're handled accordingly you can switch between viewing live and test mode by using the toggle in the stripe dashboard there's separate api keys for test in live mode you can distinguish between test and live mode keys by the extended prefix which includes the mode note that webhook signing secrets don't include the mode but publishable secret and restricted keys will show you live or test in the actual string value for the key when building your integration you'll use the test mode api keys and then when you're ready to move to production and take real payments it's a matter of replacing those keys with the live mode api keys so if for some reason your api keys are leaked or exposed as you've just seen in this demo you must roll those by going to the dashboard and using the role key action rolling will block this api key and generate a new one so we recommend reviewing the security history and the logs for the requests that were related to this key and any web hook endpoints that were created with this key will stay active even after the key is rolled so make sure to review your list of webhook endpoints to ensure that those are what you expect all right let's take a look in php we have authentication.php here so for for php the api key can be set either globally or per request the most common is to set it globally and we now have two patterns in php we have static methods we have these static methods we also have client and services so i'm going to show you how to globally set the api key in both ways so first we'll show globally set api key and it looks something like this we say stripe stripe set api key and we pass in the string value for our api key and then we can make calls to the api we'll see the results in the console here as json you can see all the json that was returned so this is using a globally set api key with the static method style this is the older pattern now if we wanted we could also change this to retrieve and pass in the string id for a customer and this would return the json for that customer now if you're using the newer client and services pattern then we can also globally set the apa the api key this way so we would say something like this we want to create a new instance of stripe is a so stripe is going to be a new stripe client where we pass in the api key when we initialize the instance and then we can make api calls with this client so now we can say something like echo you know dollar stripe customers all and this is a functionally equivalent to that first api call that we made and it returns all of the json for the same stripe account similarly we can change all to retrieve and pass in the string value for that customer id if we run it again we get back to json just for that single customer if you're using multiple of your own stripe accounts for your integration and not through connect then you might want to swap out the api key per request so all api requests will support an optional request arguments parameter where you can specify the api key so rather than setting the api key globally like this we can instead pass the api key in request parameters so we can say you know the the request body is going to be this first set of parameters we're going to leave that empty and we're going to set the api key here equal to our api key okay now notice that we're not setting the api key globally we're setting it per request so this allows us to make requests with different api keys with every single request if for some reason we were managing multiple different stripe accounts as part of our integration and not part of connect this is only if you yourself are maintaining maybe a stripe account for your european customers and a different stripe account for your u.s customers for some reason all right let's take a look at how we might set the api key per request with static methods so here i'm going to just copy this and paste it down below and then we'll say this is going to be uh per request and we'll comment this back in now we have to have an api key set um in order for this to work we have to have an api key set globally but when we make the api call to retrieve the customer we can pass in this api key in the second argument in the request params that is the second argument when we're working with static methods with the client services it's the third argument um so then we can say sk2 and this will make the api key set per request and we'll return the json for that individual customer okay let's move on to working with connect okay so let's comment this out so with connect if you're working with connect where you're collecting payments on behalf of other vendors so for example if you're building a platform like lyft or shopify you'll need to pass the id of the connected account in these request parameters the combination of your platform api key and the connected accounts id is how you authenticate requests that work with objects related to that connected account so note that you must also set this account id and your platform publishable key when working with stripe.js or stripe ios on the client also so it's not just on the server it's on the client too when you're working with objects related to that connected account you'll want to pass in your platform's api keys and your connected accounts id so let's take a look at how this works so we set our platform key globally and we're going to do it

connected account so if we run this we'll get back some json and you'll see this is the json for the customers related to this connected account so similarly we can change all to retrieve and pass in the string value for the customer we want to retrieve we see the json for that customer returned when we make the request now this also works with passing an api key per request so if we wanted to we could pass both the stripe connected account id and our platform api key per request so we could say something like api key is our platform a platform api key uh here and that would work per request uh generally when working with connect though you just need at a minimum to pass the id of the connected account and set your platform api key all right let's take a look at how this works with connect and the client services model so down below we'll copy all of this to create a new client and we'll say this is uh with connect so we're going to set our api key globally and then per request we need to set the stripe account and this is going to be the id of the connected account and initially we'll just say all return all the customers so that we can see the list of customers related to this stripe account so if we run this we should get back the list of customers we do and again we have this id for an individual customer so we can say retrieve and pass in that id and keep those request params and now we get the json for just that individual customer for the connected account so that's how you handle authentication with connect just as a super quick recap we talked about types of api keys where to find those in your stripe dashboard how to roll those how to use your api keys globally or per request and i hope you enjoyed it we'll see you in the next one\",

take a look at how you can add metadata to an object when you're working in java i've got metadata.java already open i've imported the stripe java library and i have my api key set so let's go ahead and create a customer object with some metadata i'll start by building the create params i'm going to add the customer's name and i'll add two pieces of metadata the first key will be for this customer's id within my app and the second key will be for their username go ahead and build that and then we'll create the customer so let's run this and you can see we've created a customer you can look at the metadata hash here and see the two keys that we set and i'm going to grab the customer id up here and we'll use that for the rest of this demo now what if you wanted to add additional keys to the metadata you can do that using an update call so let's add another key and this time i'm going to add a key for the customer's favorite animal which in this case happens to be a cheetah we'll retrieve the customer using that id i grabbed before then we'll make an update call using the update params we'll print it out so let's take a look now run this again and you can see now here that we've added the new um added the new metadata key and we've merged that with the existing keys that were already there so we haven't affected those keys at all with this update call now what if we wanted to change those on the values in those keys we can do that um by making another update call let's change their favorite animal it's no longer a cheetah now it's a llama make the call again you can see the favorite animal has been updated to a llama now if you wanted to remove metadata keys you can do that also using the update call but in this case you'd pass an empty string for those keys so let's clear out a couple of these keys to end this demo and so we'll remove the favorite animal and we'll remove their username run this one last time and you can see now that the only metadata key

mechanism that you can use to set a custom value and then use that value later to change the way a running process behaves so their data usually changes pretty infrequently and the application is going to treat them like constants rather than mutable variables you could think of these as things that you would consider hard coding but would rather keep the value out of your code because either it changes between environments or because hard coding the value would leak some sensitive information like your API keys so there's a couple common use cases for environment variables you may have heard of you've got execution modes domain names API keys that path variable that you're used to seeing so for API keys this is really the core use case when using environment variables for a stripe integration because exposing your secret keys can lead to a bad day so rather than hard coding your stripe API keys right in your code it's better to keep them in some sort of environment variable and even better if that file is secure encrypted and really only accessible to those who should have access to your full stripe accountant all right let's take a look at how we can interact with environment variables directly in our terminal so we can do things like set an environment variable by saying export X equals 1 to 3 and then echoing that back dollar X that's how we access the environment variable directly in our shell now we might also have a file called something like dot in environment variables that looks something like this where we have settings where we can say setting equals value and if we source that file in bash then those environment variables will be available to us so often times in your bash RC or your bash profile you'll be modifying environment variables that you want to be loaded every time a new bash session starts so how does this pertain to stripe so we use a pattern within stripe samples and with developer office hours where we create . --an file and then we use a suite of tools and libraries that allow us to import and merge those environment variables that are stored in the dot and file with those that are globally available on our machines so we can create a dot end file here and set maybe we have our stripe secret key stripe publishable key and then maybe like a demo variable abc123 okay and we're gonna go through in in the language of your choice and we will load these environment variables with the dot end packages and see how to use them within our programs all right let's take a look at how we use environment variables within the stripe samples so we head over to github and check out all of these different stripe samples which are pre-built integrations on how to that demonstrate how to build stripe stripe integrations for different products and different scenarios so if we look at this setup subscriptions stripe sample you'll notice that in the root of the project there's a dot n dot example file this dot n dot example is a template for your dot n file which will hold your your API keys and some other settings that are applicable to the sample so let's clone down this sample and take a look at where the environment variables are set so that you can go in and set up your own when working with stripe samples so you'll notice that in the root we still have this dot m dot example and we expect that that's going to be dropped into one of the server directories so I'm going to go into dot Ruby and add a dot N file or I'm sorry into the Ruby directory in the server in the server directory and add a dot n file so we want to look at the example and we want to make sure that our server matches the the keys match this the same names so I'm going to copy those over so now we have a dot end file that has our striped publishable key and we have a stripe secret key and a webhook secret might be for handling web hooks and you might have you might also have a stripe plane NID happen to have one called movies and so that's how you modify the dot end file so if we change directories into the server directory and start the Ruby server with Ruby that server dot RB that will start up a new server at localhost for two for two that we can navigate to and now our our API keys are going to be used when working with this demo all right let's check out how we can use environment variables with PHP today we're going to be using composer to install a dependency called V Lucas PHP ends so we say composer require v lucas PHP and PHP inv is going to allow us to load environment variables from a local file called dot end and merge those with the globally available environment variables that are in our environment so the way this works is we we sort of initialize an instance of dot n when we load and then we can call dot n I'm sorry just get n which is the the underlying PHP method to get environment variables and we'll note that because we're using dot end we can use environment variables that are both globally available and those from the file so let's just create a new file called PHP demo no let's call it demo dot PHP and in here we're gonna say PHP and then we need to require vendor auto load it almost did it for me ok and then we're gonna say we're gonna create a new instance of dot in and this is dot in dot and and we say create immutable and we pass it in this current directory okay so that's gonna create an instance of dot ends and when we call load it's going to load up the environment variables from that dot n file so now we can do things like print out get in with the name of the environment variable so if we pull up our dot n file here we can see that the name of the environment variable the first one we want to print out is stripe secret so we can say stripe secret not publishable stripe secret okay and maybe we also want to say like this is the secret and let's also print out X to show you that X is not defined in dot n but it was one it was something that we exported globally directly from our bash session so here we have echo X with the environment variable X and secret with the environment variable that's loaded from dot end directly here in this file so now if we say PHP demo dot PHP we get it's not it's not printing pretty but we can see X and its value 1 2 3 and then secret and then SK test so if we if we cat in we see that stripe secret was this SK test 1 2 3 SK test 1 2 3 and we don't have X in here because that was merged from a globally available environment variable called X so that's X 1 2 3 all right so that's how we use environment variables with PHP the most common use case again is going to be setting your API key when you are initializing stripe PHP alright hopefully you found this useful we'll see you next time you\", metadata={'source': 'qAkxQIYHlUw', 'title': 'Environment Variables .env with PHP', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 15495, 'thumbnail_url':

bearer authentication also called token authentication when making an api call you'll pass one of your api keys in the authorization http header with the value bearer and then a space and then your api key there's a few different types of api keys we've got publishable secret but there's also the lesser known restricted keys and also the somewhat related web hook signing secrets each type works with different permissions and use cases you can find or create these keys in your stripe dashboard publishable or public keys are used for making api requests to stripe directly from the front end these keys are used with stripe.js and mobile clients like stripe ios and stripe android these are very limited in scope because they are often visible in your client-side code so on the other hand we have these secret keys which are used to make api calls from your server to the stripe api and secret keys are never visible to the end user it should never be used with client-side code or shipped with mobile apps so your publishable and secret keys are going to be the most common most commonly used your api keys carry many privileges so be sure to keep them secure don't share your secret api keys in publicly accessible places like github or frontend code or you know any other place where users or people that you don't want having access to your stripe account might see two other types of keys that you might encounter are these restricted keys in web hook signing secrets so the restricted key is similar to a secret key however they provide you greater security by allowing you more granular control over which actions can be performed for specific resources so for instance you can create a restricted key which allows only the reading of the list of customers and you can use that api key to retrieve customers webhook signing secrets are used on the server to verify that webhook payloads did indeed come from stripe it's very specialized key so each of these api key types is a string that begins with the prefixes shown and ends with a random string of letters and numbers so pk underscore for publishable key sk underscore for secret key rk underscore for restricted key and wh sec underscore for web webhook signing secrets now when you're working with payments it's critical to make sure your integration works as expected and so stripe provides a test mode and several test card numbers to trigger different flows in your integration and ensure they're handled accordingly you can switch between viewing live and test mode by using the toggle in the stripe dashboard there's separate api keys for test in live mode you can distinguish between test and live mode keys by the extended prefix which includes the mode note that webhook signing secrets don't include the mode but publishable secret and restricted keys will show you live or test in the actual string value for the key when building your integration you'll use the test mode api keys and then when you're ready to move to production and take real payments it's a matter of replacing those keys with the live mode api keys so if for some reason your api keys are leaked or exposed as you've just seen in this demo you must roll those by going to the dashboard and using the role key action rolling will block this api key and generate a new one so we recommend reviewing the security history and the logs for the requests that were related to this key and any web hook endpoints that were created with this key will stay active even after the key is rolled so make sure to review your list of webhook endpoints to ensure that those are what you expect all right let's take a look in php we have authentication.php here so for for php the api key can be set either globally or per request the most common is to set it globally and we now have two patterns in php we have static methods we have these static methods we also have client and services so i'm going to show you how to globally set the api key in both ways so first we'll show globally set api key and it looks something like this we say stripe stripe set api key and we pass in the string value for our api key and then we can make calls to the api we'll see the results in the console here as json you can see all the json that was returned so this is using a globally set api key with the static method style this is the older pattern now if we wanted we could also change this to retrieve and pass in the string id for a customer and this would return the json for that customer now if you're using the newer client and services pattern then we can also globally set the apa the api key this way so we would say something like this we want to create a new instance of stripe is a so stripe is going to be a new stripe client where we pass in the api key when we initialize the instance and then we can make api calls with this client so now we can say something like echo you know dollar stripe customers all and this is a functionally equivalent to that first api call that we made and it returns all of the json for the same stripe account similarly we can change all to retrieve and pass in the string value for that customer id if we run it again we get back to json just for that single customer if you're using multiple of your own stripe accounts for your integration and not through connect then you might want to swap out the api key per request so all api requests will support an optional request arguments parameter where you can specify the api key so rather than setting the api key globally like this we can instead pass the api key in request parameters so we can say you know the the request body is going to be this first set of parameters we're going to leave that empty and we're going to set the api key here equal to our api key okay now notice that we're not setting the api key globally we're setting it per request so this allows us to make requests with different api keys with every single request if for some reason we were managing multiple different stripe accounts as part of our integration and not part of connect this is only if you yourself are maintaining maybe a stripe account for your european customers and a different stripe account for your u.s customers for some reason all right let's take a look at how we might set the api key per request with static methods so here i'm going to just copy this and paste it down below and then we'll say this is going to be uh per request and we'll comment this back in now we have to have an api key set um in order for this to work we have to have an api key set globally but when we make the api call to retrieve the customer we can pass in this api key in the second argument in the request params that is the second argument when we're working with static methods with the client services it's the third argument um so then we can say sk2 and this will make the api key set per request and we'll return the json for that individual customer okay let's move on to working with connect okay so let's comment this out so with connect if you're working with connect where you're collecting payments on behalf of other vendors so for example if you're building a platform like lyft or shopify you'll need to pass the id of the connected account in these request parameters the combination of your platform api key and the connected accounts id is how you authenticate requests that work with objects related to that connected account so note that you must also set this account id and your platform publishable key when working with stripe.js or stripe ios on the client also so it's not just on the server it's on the client too when you're working with objects related to that connected account you'll want to pass in your platform's api keys and your connected accounts id so let's take a look at how this works so we set our platform key globally and we're going to do it first with static methods and then separately we're going to say customer.all and pass in the connected account id so here we want to say stripe account point set and then the account id for the connected account so if we run this we'll get back some json and you'll see this is the json for the customers related to this connected account so similarly we can change all to retrieve and pass in the string value for the customer we want to retrieve we see the json for that customer returned when we make the request now this also works with passing an api key per request so if we wanted to we could pass both the stripe connected account id and our platform api key per request so we could say something like api key is our platform a platform api key uh here and that would work per request uh generally when working with connect though you just need at a minimum to pass the id of the connected account and set your platform api key all right let's take a look at how this works with connect and the client services model so down below we'll copy all of this to create a new client and we'll say this is uh with connect so we're going to set our api key globally and then per request we need to set the stripe account and this is going to be the id of the connected account and initially we'll just say all return all the customers so that we can see the list of customers related to this stripe account so if we run this we should get back the list of customers we do and again we have this id for an individual customer so we can say retrieve and pass in that id and keep those request params and now we get the json for just that individual customer for the connected account so that's how you handle authentication with connect just as a super quick recap we talked about types of api keys where to find those in your stripe dashboard how to roll those how to use your api keys globally or per request and i hope you enjoyed it we'll see you in the next one\", metadata={'source': 'CeufP46S5BI', 'title':

jojo dot go.n and we'll create a demo.go file which we can say package main and we're going to import let's see we need format and we need os and we need this this guy here so we will import all of these and then we'll say main and the way that this works is we're going to load um dot n using go to end the the method called load and then we need to check and see if there's any errors when we

secret key okay similarly i want to demo that you can you can also access these globally available environment variables so we set one called x at the beginning of the episode and we're going to now access that and print that out so when we're using go.n it's going to load your your dot end file variables that are set and merge those with those that are globally available okay so we say go run demo.go now we see the secret is here and x is one two three so if we echo x we can see that that's one of our globally available environment variables but if we try to echo stripe secret that's not globally available because it's only defined in that dot end file this is one of the ways you can work with environment variables with go and the most common use case is that we have a dot end file where we're going to store our stripe api keys and then use those to initialize the stripe go library we're going to interact with that client library to make requests all right hopefully you found this useful we'll see you next time [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'TWF6VUyxQ84', 'title': 'Environment Variables .env with Go', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 2619, 'thumbnail_url':

standard restful conventions it uses those standard http requests and responses with predictable resource oriented urls request bodies are form encoded and responses are json encoded http requests you make can send data to stripe servers in one of three parts of the request in the request body this is where you pass parameters to create update and take specific actions on objects so for instance if you're creating a customer the customer's email address might be something that you pass in the body of a post request http headers which is where the configuration like api key and api version are sent you know in our docs will often refer to the arguments as request params there's also query string params most often used for filtering lists with get requests in this video you'll learn how to format request parameters so that you can effectively work from the api reference to make most requests and build almost any supported stripe integration the api reference is the detailed documentation about each resource cataloging the supported parameters some sample requests and responses generally when building an integration you'll follow an official guide but may need some specialized params to solve for your specific use case on the left you'll find a list of resources expanding customers shows which api endpoints are available for working with customers under the customer resource we see the customer object and methods for creating retrieving updating deleting and listing customers the customer object describes the shape and attributes of an instance of a customer that's returned in the responses from the stripe api you'll notice that some attributes are marked with the expand label we'll cover the expand feature of the api and how to work with it from client libraries in more detail in another episode however i just want to show that this is how from the api reference you can tell which attributes are expandable the create a customer api endpoint describes the parameters sent to the stripe api when creating a customer on the far right side we see a code snippet example with some basic params note that you can switch from curl to the stripe cli or any of our officially supported client libraries to see a basic code snippet in the programming language you're most familiar with in the next section of the api reference we'll see details about making a request to create a customer these are the parameters that can be sent in the post body to the stripe api to create customer objects the most common parameters are listed at the top and then additional or more advanced parameters are included below under the more parameters subheading if your account's default api version is older than the latest version then you might also see a panel with information about breaking changes released in a newer api version note that all parameters for creating a customer here are optional if we look at the create a payment intent reference you'll see a label showing that the amount and currency parameters are required in some cases parameters might be conditionally required as is true for off session the values for these parameters or the arguments can be scalar values associative arrays arrays of associative arrays or arrays of strings so the sub associative arrays or child parameters can also be deeply nested as is the case with shipping address some params might be enums like tax exempt which accepts the values none exempt or reverse in this episode we'll cover how to construct the arguments passed to the client library so that you're confident in passing scalar values or more complex nested associative arrays right so i've created a file called demo requests.php with stripe php installed via composer and imported and i've got my api key set so let's start with a very simple request to create a customer so i'm going to say create a customer with no params and it looks something like this we're going to say customer is equal to stripe customers create and then we're just going to echo out that customer and then i'll run the code here on the left hand side and in the terminal you can see the results that were returned from stripe so in the terminal output you can see the customer object returned in the attributes that are populated for you by default now if we wanted to fetch this single customer later on we would do so by making a get request with this id um so let's do that next so we can update this and we'll make another method here called uh retrieve customer and that works something like so customer is equal to stripe customers retrieve and this just takes in the string value for the id of the customer so if we run this code again we're going to see the same json returned as we saw when we created the customer but this time we're just fetching the customer that we just created now the id of the customer in this case is going to be set in the path for the request so this is going to be something like v1 customers slash cuss underscore and then the id of the customer there's uh when we're making a retrieve call like this we're not passing anything in the request body and in this specific case we're not passing anything in the request parameters either all right so let's spice things up a bit and create another customer this time with some scalar values create a customer with scalar values stripe customers create and then we're going to pass in as its first argument an associative array with the keys email and the value jenny rosen's email and the key name and the value jenny rosen for the name of the customer and again we're just going to print this out and we'll let's actually also print out the the name and email of the customer all right so we're going to run this you'll see at the very bottom we get jenny rosen and we get the jennyrosen.example.com so this is being printed out and we are able to um pass in some scalar values to create a customer and we can access those in the customer object that is returned again the stripe api expects parameters to be passed as form and coded data in the post body not as json so the response that comes back from the stripe api is json but the request is form encoded so this is what the post body would look like in this case we would have you know a email equal to jenny.rosen at example.com and then in ampersand separating the email key value pair from the name key value pair we'd have jenny and then maybe percent 20 rosen so this is what the the url or the form encoded post body the string would look like when you're working with the stripe php client library it's going to abstract this away so you don't have to think about it but it's something to keep in mind if you're going to attempt to make some requests outside of the context of straight php so yeah keep that in mind if you're going to manually start to implement requests okay next i want to talk about enums so some scalar some scalars accept specific enum values so the tax exempt parameter on customer accepts one of none exempt or reversed so let's say we're going to create a customer with an enum and here we're going to say customer is equal to again stripe customers create with this associative array and this time we're going to pass tax exempt and we'll pass one of the valid values reverse and then we're going to say echo dollar customer and then we can execute this so that created a brand new customer with its tax exempt value set to reverse we could set this to none and then run the code again and we would see that the tax exempt is set to none these are both valid evening values if we were to pass an invalid value for the enum then you'll see that we get a 400 http status code in the response and the error message is going to tell us that we've passed an invalid value for tax exempt it must be one of none reverse or exempt so it's going to tell us when when we're using a value for the enum that is invalid let's also just show like what it would look like to create a customer uh with an invalid parameter so if we just grab these if i tried to pass in um email underscore address recall that the the actual parameter is actually just email but if we pass an email underscore address and attempt to create a customer this way then when we execute this code we're again going to get a 400 error but this time the error message says received unknown parameter and then the name of the parameter email address so it's telling us that this parameter is invalid most common reason for this is just not typing the name of the parameter correctly so you want to check the spelling for your parameter name but it's also possible that your api version the name of the parameter changed in your api version so a couple things to check out there all right so let's up the stakes yet again and send some nested data inside of one of these child parameters with nested associative array um so here we're going to say something like the customer is equal to a a new customer and this time we're going to pass a scalar value at the top level so this is going to be pm card visa and i'll talk about that in a second and then we're also going to pass invoice settings which itself is not a scalar but it is a another associative array so this is a nested or child parameter so default payment method here is a pm card visa okay if we echo that customer invoice settings you can see what i'm talking about all right so that now we've got we've got back uh this sub object or this nested object called invoice settings and it has custom fields default payment method and then a footer so pm card visa is one of the test payment method ids if we pass this at the top level in payment method and also inside of invoice settings p default payment method then our resulting test customer can successfully make recurring payments uh in test mode again for billing subscription or for other invoices so this is how we can create a test customer without without needing to do any tokenization and also demonstrating you know just how to pass some nested some nested data here next i wanted to show you how we can pass in a list of strings so in the case of a customer it supports a parameter called preferred locales so we're going to say create customer with list of strings and here we'll say the customer is equal to stripe customers create the parameter is called preferred locales and it takes a list of strings so maybe this customer speaks both english and spanish i wish that i could speak spanish so we're going to print back out that customer let's also print their preferred locales okay let's see oh all right so this didn't this did not get converted to a string so let's uh preferred locales let's grab the first one and the second one all right so we see en and es they're they're combined here at the bottom and we also see that the preferred locales for this customer have been set to english and spanish so that's how we can pass a list of strings to the stripe api so now that we've created several customers let's see how we can update an existing customer so the concepts from earlier are going to apply however we'll also need to pass the id of the object we want to update so all objects in the stripe api have this string id a customer is going to start with cus underscore and when updating the customer we're going to pass that as the first argument to the update method so here we might say customer is equal to you know stripe customers update so this is going to be the first argument and then the second argument is an associative array with all of our parameters to update the customer so let's update the customer's email address for this customer and we'll just set it to jr example.com all right so let's print out this customer's id and their email address okay so if we run this we see that we printed out the id of the customer and then their email address had a just a space in here and the next thing that we want to do is show that if i change this to jr2 we are going to update that customer the id did not change but now their email address is set to jr2 so that's how you can update a customer with just some simple params we can also follow this same pattern for updating a customer and passing these nested associative arrays so let's now update a customer with nested params so we can say the same same sort of thing so customer is equal to stripe customers update and we want to pass in again the id of the customer and this time we want to pass in um invoice settings and we saw an example earlier with invoice settings where we set the default payment method there's another uh parameter we can pass as part of invoice settings called custom fields and in this case it is an array of associative arrays so here we have two sets of square brackets we have the outer square brackets that says this is going to be a list of sort of objects and then the inner square bracket is the associative array that represents the key value pairs so custom field objects support a name and a common use case is to pass in a tax id here so we might say the name is vat and the value is three abc let's move this up and so that is going to create a brand new or it's going to update this customer it's going to pass in this nested list of associative arrays so now we can echo out uh customer invoice settings and you'll see what i'm talking about so here the stripe object for invoice settings will show you the json when we print it out including the custom fields here which is again a list of these sub-objects which now have a name and value for that and the id the tax id there while talking about tax ids there is now official support in the api for account tax ids so if you're interested in that go check out merchant tax ids okay we can also make a get request to fetch a page from the list of customers with the all method let's do that here so we're going to say fetch a list of customers and it looks like this customers is equal to stripe customers all and then we're going to echo customers we can also just say like maybe we say for each customer's data so data is actually going to be the array or the list of customer objects as cuss and we can just echo maybe we echo out the id of the customer and um let's put a new line okay we're running and you'll see at the bottom here that we have the list of all the ids of all the different customers by default this endpoint is going to return 10 objects max for the page stripe.php also supports autopagination which is a handy tool for working with lists so we have another episode about pagination and we show how to use these list endpoints in more detail showing the limit ending before and starting after parameters all these are covered in the pagination episode so go check that out the customer list endpoint turns out that it can also be used to filter a list of customers by email address so i'm just going to grab this comment this out and say we're going to fetch a list of customers filtered by email and here i can pass in an associative array with email as one of the top level arguments jenny.rosenat example.com and this will make a get request to fetch customers and only those customers with that email address so to show this while we're printing out the id of the customer we'll also print out actually yeah let's say we have the customer id and then that's going to be with a space and then we'll print the customers email okay so if we run this we should see yeah you'll see all the customer ids and the email addresses so a customer object in stripe is not uniquely identifiable by their email address every you can reuse the same email address across multiple customers in your stripe account so here we see ids for several different customers and then the email address that we have filtered by so now we're just pulling a list of customers filtered by email and in this case the email the email value here the key and value are passed in the query string parameters for the get request to the list endpoint for customers so occasionally you may want to delete an object delete expects the id of the object to be deleted so let's delete one of these customers we've created so we're going to say stripe customers delete and we're going to pass in the id of the customer and we'll just print that out so this is how you delete a customer if we run this you'll see that the object was deleted if we pull up the documentation for the payment intent resource you'll see that there are some additional api methods on the left in addition to the standard crud operations some resources support additional actions also known as custom methods in the case of a payment intent you'll see the confirm capture and cancel methods these work similar to update api calls but use a special api path and perform a specific action on an underlying object when we veer away from the standard create retrieve update delete and list operations the custom method names follow a verb naming convention so for instance we have dispute.close paymentintent.confirm charge.capture etc the client library will expose access to custom methods in a predictable way using a name that matches the verb seen in the api reference next up i want to talk about custom methods and to demonstrate let's create and then confirm a payment intent so we're first going to create a payment intent with just the amount and id say intent is equal to stripe payment intense create and we want to pass in an amount ten dollars and the currency is usd so this will create a brand new payment intent we want to echo out its id let's also echo out its uh status okay so we'll run this code and we get back a payment intent and its status is requires payment method so this is how we create a payment intent and by default payment intents are not confirmed automatically so then the next step is to confirm the payment intent so we're next we're going to pass that id into the custom confirm method to uh with a test payment method to confirm this so now we can say something like intent is equal to stripe payment intense confirm and now we want to pass in the id of the payment intent that we want to confirm as the first argument and then the second argument are any other any parameters that are related to this action that we're taking so we need to pass in a payment method and we can use that pm card visa that we talked about earlier that test payment method and then down below again we'll just echo out um the id and the status of this payment intent so we're going to run this and you'll see that the status is now succeeded again we have the same payment intent id um so the custom method here is called confirm when we veer from the standard crud operations like create read update delete the method in stripe.php will be a predictable a predictable method name that matches the name of the verb in the api reference for the action that we're taking on that given object so in the case of confirm or capture or close for a dispute those are all going to be just the name of the verb is the method that's in the client library that you can call some api endpoints are nested under higher level resources so for example when working with a list of lines for an invoice those are accessible through a path which includes the id of the invoice like so sometimes accessing these nested resources requires first fetching an instance of the parent resource in this case an invoice and then second making an api call to list its lines let's take a look next let's talk about nested service methods so on an invoice object an invoice has line items and if you wanted to retrieve those line items you could do so through this nested service methods we can say lines is equal to stripe invoices all lines and then the first argument is the the id of the parent resource so in this case it's going to be an invoice id and then the second argument are the list parameters for filtering this line list of lines so this is this is a list endpoint that is nested under a parent resource so we can pass the standard list parameters here so we might say limit limit five and then echo lines so i'm going to grab an invoice id with the stripe cli stripe invoices list limit 1 pipe to jq dot okay so this should give me an invoice id that we can use okay so i'm going to grab that id enter it here and now when we run our code we should see yeah so we should we see the the invoice line items that are related to this invoice so this is how we can make requests to a nested service method now technically under the hood this is making a request to v1 invoices in xxx like the id of the parent resources slash lines and because of this query string parameter here we're passing in limit equals five so that's kind of what this looks like is we have a bit that is the query string param we have the by saying all lines we know that we're doing a list method for the lines which are nested under this parent resource so that is how we access a a nested service method okay thus far our examples have passed data into the client library methods and the client library has form encoded and sent those values to the stripe api either as part of the request body or in the query string params let's turn to passing configuration options in the request headers headers are most commonly used for authentication versioning and stripe connect you'll want to refer to the authentication episode to learn about how api keys are passed or to the versioning episode about how to specify the api version in the headers either globally or per request so the particular use case i want to cover briefly here is for stripe connect connect enables you to build a platform to facilitate payments for other sellers or vendors users connect their stripe account to your stripe account and then you can make api calls on their behalf once connected this works by passing the id of the connected account in the http headers let's take a look at how to pass the connect account id header now so far all of the api calls that we've made have been related to our own account with stripe connect and in the case of passing a per request api key or a per request api version or with with stripe connect the id of the connected account we can take actions on behalf of accounts that have connected to us so in the case where we wanted to create another customer but this time on a connected stripe account we can say customer is equal to stripe customers create and recall that we have been passing in this top level argument maybe it has an email address and this is how we can create a customer on our own account but it turns out that the create and update and most methods when working with objects in the stripe api and with stripe php are going to accept this final optional argument where you can pass in these request params or request options you can think of it as a way to configure the request and so this might be your per request api version or api key but you can also pass stripe account here and uh i want i just wanted to call this out that this is a us a an argument that is a completely separate associative array which includes these request configuration options and in this case we can pass a stripe account value and the string value being the id of an account that has connected to my platform so that i can take actions on their behalf now if we run this code we'll see that it creates a customer object and if we inspected that more closely we would know that this customer object is attached to this connected account it does not connect is not attached to the platform it's connected to this disconnect account so this just wanted to call out that this is how you pass the request params or request options to configure the request and this stripe account here is actually sent in the headers the request headers when making a request this is not in the body so the email will be sent in the body the stripe account will be sent in the header as a quick recap in this episode you learn how to make requests to the stripe api to create retrieve update delete and list resources we looked at the api reference documentation covered custom methods nested services and passing request headers for connect thanks so much for watching we'll see in the next one you\", metadata={'source': 'Fc75MwzT4MI', 'title': 'Making requests with

Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"today we'll be talking about how to use cursor-based pagination and auto-pagination with stripes apis before we dive into what this looks like in each of our client libraries i'll go over some of the basics of making list requests all top-level api resources have support for bulk fetches through list methods that split up the results into chunks known as pages these api methods will return results one page at a time in reverse chronological order and the requests all share common structure they can take in three optional parameters limit starting after and ending before the limit parameter is used to specify how many objects you want to fetch per call the starting after and ending before parameters take in an existing object id and are mutually exclusive only one of the two can be used in a single request setting the starting after parameter returns the next page of results that come after the passed in object setting the ending before parameter returns the previous page of results that comes before the specified object as we go through each language you'll see examples of how these parameters are used with cursor-based pagination and how that compares to auto-pagination i've created a file called pagination.php with stripe.php installed and my api key already set using the new client and services pattern this is the new and recommended way to initialize the stripe client and work with stripe.php that said if you're working with an older version of stripe.php you might be using the static method style you can tell which pattern you use based on the way the api key is set this is just a small example of how the api key is set in the older static method style for today's demo we'll be sticking with the newer style client and services model some of the doc snippets have not yet been updated so keep in mind you might need to refer to the api reference let's start by listing a page of customers you based on the output i can see that only 10 customers will return from stripe even though i have more customers on my account that's because each page returned from a list request will have 10 objects by default we can change that by setting the limit parameter which can be any integer between one and one hundred but what if we want more than just the two most recently created customers in order to get the next page of results we can use the ids of the customers returned from the api response for instance we can see that the last customer has this id we can use this as input to tell the api to give us the next two results that come after this customer by setting starting after you can see that this response gives back different customers than the first response it also has a has more property as we page through customers hazmar will tell us whether there are additional pages of customers we can retrieve if you wanted to page the customers in the opposite direction you could set ending before to the id of the first customer in the return list this is known as cursor-based pagination when you put all these concepts together you can write code to create and print a list of all our customer ids you first we do an initial call to retrieve and store the ids of the first 10 customers then we make subsequent calls to retrieve the next sets of customers until has more is no longer true finally we print out our results now you may be thinking that this is a lot of code to just print out all of your customer ids this is where auto pagination comes in our client libraries offer auto pagination helpers to easily traverse all pages of a list we can set our limit to the maximum page size of 100 and then use auto pagination to cycle through every customer and grab their id this code does the exact same thing as a regular pagination example it has all the ids to a list prints the list and prints the total number of customers as you can see in the examples using auto pagination allows you to easily handle bulk fetches with code that's clean and easy to understand thanks for watching if you have any questions or run into any issues let us know\",

engineer here at stripe in this week's episode of developer office hours we're going to be talking about sharing cards across from platform accounts to connected accounts for those platforms that use direct charges but need to share the customer payment methods from the platform to the connected account so why would you want to do this so imagine that you're building a platform that's a store builder you may want to enable the end customer to be able to save their card details for one merchant and then be able to use those card details for all of the other merchants that exist under your platform without having to re-enter their their payment details every single time so what card sharing allows you to do is it allows you to save the customer and the customer's payment methods on the platform account and then share it to the connected account and in this video we're going to talk about how you can use card sharing to create one-time tokens so that you can save all of the customer objects and payment methods on the platform and then whenever a user needs to use one of those payment methods for any merchant they can simply uh select the select the payment method and then just as they're about to make a payment you make a clone you consume it and then the customer is able to complete their payment without having to re-enter their payment uh information and on your end you won't have to keep state on all the different payment methods for all the different uh connected accounts for all of the different customers in your database or anything like that you'll just create these one-time ephemeral tokens and have a very lightweight easy to use approach to sharing customers across multiple connected accounts so let's before we actually run this demo let's just see what it looks like to have a to have this set up so in my stripe dashboard i actually have two things uh pulled up in two tabs i have one so what we have here is the uh strike dashboard for a platform and we're looking at a specific customer now this is a customer that has four payment methods attached to the customer object and in this setup you would store the cards on the platform but because you're doing direct charges you won't actually have any payments on the platform so in this setup you would expect to see a customer who has payment methods but then no payments and then for every connected account you would have another customer and that customer would have payments but no payment methods because you would be using one-time tokens so let's take a look at what the connected account would look like so here is a connected account that is attached to the platform that i just showed you and here's another version of that genie rosen uh customer now this is a instance of that customer on the connected account now keep in mind this customer isn't actually linked to uh the customer on the platform it just has the same information they don't keep stay with each other at all and in fact they have different customer ids but they do represent the same customer who exists in real life and as i said before when you use car sharing you're going to have payments but no payment methods now i just created this customer so there are no payments but let's see what it looks like to use a one-time token to share a card with a customer on the connected account and accept the payment now let's put it into practice we're going to generate a one-time token from the platform customers payment method their mastercard and then we're going to share it with the connected account and then we're going to make a payment and the payment is going to be attached to the customer that exists on the connected account all right great so we can see that we created the card from the platform account then we created a clone of the car and shared it with the connected account we got a new card for our connected account and we were able to use that new car to confirm our payment intent uh using the client secret on the client side and we were able to successfully make the payment now if we go into our dashboard again we will be able to see that the jenny rosen customer on the connected account has a payment but no payment methods let's just refresh here perfect so now that we know what we're doing let's get started actually building out this demo let's get started so we're going to begin by bootstrapping our app using their stripe cli if you have a stripe cli installed and you're logged in you can use the command stripe samples create to create a boilerplate app so that's what we're going to start with today we'll just type in developer office hours this is going to give us like a folder with a server and a client index date index.html file basic server file so let's do that and you can pick a server in any one of the languages that stripe supports now let's install our dependencies actually i also have some templates that i like to use so let's let's just do that okay now let's install our dependencies okay we have our dependencies installed we have our boilerplate app we uh we should be all set up here so let's just open up our code editor all right so like i said before this is what we get when we open up a uh when we open up the border plate code you get a client folder with one html file we get a server folder with a server.pi file and of course we have our requirements that we needed to install okay so this file is really really basic it uh pulls in your stripe secret key from a dot in file that has created and it has your stripe secret key if you're already logged in it also has a basic route that's just going to uh return this index.html page that has like a nice form uh where you can set up a button and things like that and then we have a webhook handler we're not actually going to be using webhooks for this example so we'll just delete that and i'm just going to set this to debug equals true so that our server refreshes every time we make a change okay let's just make sure that this works all right perfect so this looks like our example before but uh it just doesn't have any functionality it doesn't have any payment any payment methods from the platform listed so let's fix that so we're going to we're going to start by going to our server.pi file and what we're going to do is just make um an api call to the server.pi file uh we're making it what we're going to do is uh make it an api call to stripe uh specifically we're going to want to list the uh payment methods for the customer on the platform account but in order to do that we're going to actually need to get the uh customer id from that platform account so let's just hop over into the stripe dashboard so that we can get that information okay so we're in the strike dashboard and you could do this programmatically but for this example we only have one customer so we're just going to grab this customer here and as you can see this customer has four different payment methods and a customer id let's copy the customer id and hop back into our file uh let's just put this inside of the m file here let's say we'll call this the stripe platform customer id okay we're also going to need the strike connected id uh connected account id now that's that's the connected account that we're going to be making direct charges for so let's hop back over to the dashboard and grab that okay and here's the id we're just going to copy this over as well so we'll just call this the stripe connected account id and we're also going to be um we're not just going to pull the customer uh we're not going to just pull payment i payment methods from the platform customer we're also going to make those charges against a representation of the same customer but on the connected account and the reason we want to do this is so that if we ever wanted to pull all the transactions for a specific customer we would be able to do it by associating each transaction each charge with the customer on the connected account so let's hop back into the dashboard one last time and we're going to actually look at the dashboard for the connected account and not the platform this is the connected account seeing it from the uh view of the platform we can also see it directly here and here is the same customer that is represented on the platform account now you notice this has a different id because it's a different customer object they have similar information but they're not actually the same thing and what this customer is going to do is this customer is going to have payments but no payment methods because we're going to be passing it one time payment method tokens whereas the jenny rosen customer on the platform will have payment methods but it won't have any uh actual payments so let's just take a look at that here so again so the payment methods in this setup where we're using one-time tokens for one-time payments we're going to have our payment methods stored on a customer object on the platform and then we're going to have our payments actually associated with the customer object that exists on the connected account and by having this setup it will allow us to store the payment methods in a single place while also having all of our transactions linked to a customer uh in the respective connected connected account so now that we have that information let's just go back to server.pi and we are going to call this one the stripe connected customer id and paste that in there okay so now that we have that we can just pull in some of those uh values there so uh what did we call these things i'm just going to copy this i can remember what they were called so we're going to say that the stripe the platform customer is going to be equal to the platform customer and the uh connected customer it's going to be equal to os.getm this connectedcustomer and let's just get rid of this value here and the connected account customer is the connected account is going to be equal to this value here and let's clean this up here okay so we have the values that we need to build out our use case uh so let's just list the payment methods for the customer on the platform account great so now that we have the cards it's going to come in as a list we will want to actually uh render these cards uh on index.html so flash uses ginger templates which means that we can just pass it in as an argument here say cards equal to cards and later on we are going to use stripe.js and in order to use stripe.js we're going to need to pass in two things uh first because we're using um because we're using connect and we're going to be making api calls on behalf of a connect account connected account we are going to want to pass that in so that when we initialize um strike.js so let's just say the connected account equals uh the connected account we're also going to need to pass the publishable key now the publishable key is what allows stripe.js to make api calls uh or just do things in general with stripe on the client side so we're going to pass that in as well so we're going to pass the publishable key that's going to be equal to os.get hems stripe publishable key and we're going to now have to hop into our index.html file to actually make uh use of this list of cards here so our index.html file has the typical uh boilerplate that you will get with stripe samples uh mine also has uh just these two little details here um to differentiate it a bit and remind us of what we're doing uh it also has this script tag which is uh strike.js this is what this is we're going to be using to uh complete the payment on the client side and in general you're going to need this to uh do anything really with stripe on the client's eye using the strike.js library so let's just um render these cards out so what we're going to do is we have a list of cards that's being shared with the template so we're just going to make an unordered list and for every car we're going to add a list item that is a radio button that has some information about the car [Music] great so you can see that here we have our uh jinja for loop here where we're making a list item it's radio button and we're going to pass along the brand the id the last four digits of the card and then the expiration details so let's take a look at this and just save everything here okay cool so let's take a look if we refresh we should see a list of our cards and we do so these are all the cards that exist for that jenny rosen customer on the platform and if you look at these ids and these expiration dates these are all um which you would see on the dashboard for that customer and we can just verify that by popping back into the dashboard so that was the mastercard and this is also the mastercard you can see that we have the uh same id here and we also have the same expiration date so that's working as expected so the next step is going to be to actually get to the meat of this video which is sharing the car now our approach to sharing cards for this use case is going to be to create a one-time reusable token to create a one-time non-reusable token so that you can immediately uh check out one of the advantages to this approach is that we won't have to keep state on which cards exist on the platform we'll just list whatever happens to exist and then we'll create a one-time token just in time for the payment and so you'll never create a token that you won't use and you won't have to build a database or anything like that to uh or build or um set up web hooks or anything like that to essentially uh keep state on what's happening on the platform so that you can sync it with what's happening on the connected account so that's going to be our next step so let's hop back into our server.pi file or actually um yeah let's hop back into the server.pi file so what we're going to do is the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to create a route um for uh sharing a card from the platform to the connected account okay so our app our app.row is going to call it sharecard and it is going to um be uh post only and what we're going to do here is uh we're going to call it sharecard and let's think about what we're going to do here so the first thing we're going to need to do in order to share a card from the platform to the connected account is actually get the card that we want to share so uh on the front end we're just going to make sure that whatever we select we pass it on to um we pass it on to this route so let's say that the payment method and that's just a generalized uh term for cards and all other forms of payment we're going to say the payment method is the request dot json.get payment method and once we have the payment method we can actually just create a new payment method that is a duplicate of the payment method on the platform customer and share it with the connected account customer all in one call so what does this look like so what we're going to do is we're going to call um we're going to call the payment method um the payment method endpoint and we're going to pass it three parameters the first parameter is just going to be the platform customer now this is the customer that actually has the card uh the second parameter is going to be um the payment method and this is the payment method that the platform customer actually owns and then the third parameter is going to be the stripe account now this is going to be account the account that you want to uh share the card with so what's going on here again we're just getting a customer a specific card that's a link to that customer and we're saying hey stripe please create a duplicate of this account of this card and share it with this connected account that's attached to my platform now once we have this shared card what we need to return to the client is just the shared card id we don't need to we don't need to uh return the entire uh object because when you're doing client-side confirmation only thing you really need is the id of the payment method so we're just going to do that just going to return [Music] the um we'll just call this card because it's always going to be a card um we're just going to return the shared card.id and um let's see what we got here okay yeah let's just start with that and let's just add some comments as well just just in case so share the card with the share the platform customers card with the connected account okay and this is fairly self-explanatory but we'll just give it a note as well okay now let's hop back into index.html and uh begin to add some functionality to the uh the form button as well as begin to make use of strike.js so in this in this example we're just going to be doing everything in this javascript tag and the first thing that we're going to want to do is just set up stripe now what does it mean to set up stripe essentially you are going to um pass to stripe the publishable key this is what belongs to the platform and it allows you to make calls for the platform as well as calls on behalf of the connected accounts that are connected to the platform the second argument is going to be the stripe account that you're actually making calls for so by default if you just initialize uh strike.js with just a publishable key you are making calls for your platform account um if you want to make calls for the connected account and you and you do when you're making direct charges because uh that's the pattern you make a call with you make a call for a specific connected account you need to specify that here now while we while we're doing this example we'll want to see what's going on we have this debug message div here so let's just take advantage of it we're going to create a function that's going to uh just let us push messages to that div okay and eventually um that did that div is going to get really busy so we want to have some way to uh clear it out as well okay so let's see we uh we've initialized stripe and let's just put a comment for that one [Music] and we have our [Music] we have our debug function so that we can kind of log things as they happen so what do we want to do next the next thing we want to do is uh get the form so that we can start we can add an event listener and add some functionality to it so what we're going to do is we're just going to get the form and we're going to ask event listener to um submit and what we're going to do first is uh let's see well what are we trying to accomplish we want to share the card so we need to figure out which card is being uh which card is selected when we click submit so let's just do that we're going to get the card it's currently selected okay and once we have the card that's currently selected we have what we need to share the card so let's do that too share the card with the connected account using um our share card endpoint so let's do that and what we're going to do is we're just going to use fetch we're going to fetch from uh that share card endpoint and we're just going to pass it the payment method um of the card that we have so we're just going to pass in whatever card we selected and that card would be a card from uh the platform customer and we're going to get back a response with the card so let's actually add some messages in here so that we can see that these two things are actually going to be different so we're going to um put in a debug message here to say got the card from we'll just say what the card is getting the card from the platform account and let's just throw a message in here to say that we're about to create a clone and share it and let's call out to connect account and uh once we have finally gotten our response from our sure court endpoint let's just um show what that looks like so we're going to say we got a new car for our connected account and it's going to be the card okay so let's take a look at what we got here so we have we're getting the form we have an event listener we are going to just get the select currently selected card and then we're going to log it out to our debug messages div and then we're going to announce that we're creating a card um we're creating another card based on we're creating another card for the connected account based on the card that exists on the platform using our endpoint and then once we get a response from that endpoint we're just going to say we're just going to announce that we have it and see what it looks like and ideally the card here is going to look different from the card there all right so let's take a look at um let's take a look and we're just going to click the mastercard okay so that didn't work [Music] and it looks like we have an error somewhere in our server.pi file and it's a misspelling okay so that needed to be shared card so let's take a look here all right so let's try that one more time okay perfect so we have we um got the card and we got it from the uh platform account then we announced that we were creating clone from for the connected account and then after we called our share card endpoint we actually did manage to get a new payment method now this payment method represents the same card as before but it's associated with the connected account so now that we have this we can just create a endpoint that an endpoint on our server.pi file that allows us to create a payment intent and then we can hop back into our um client and actually and actually just use strike.js to confirm the car payment and we'll be done okay so let's do that so um first let's just create a new route and we're going to create a new route and this route is going to be to create a payment so we're creating a route for making a payment intent [Music] and this is [Music] pretty general here we're just going to call it create payment intent it's also going to uh be post only [Music] and uh we're going to make a minimum viable payment intent here and this payment intent is going to have an amount um it's going to have an amount and since it's going to have a currency it's going to have the stripe account and the stripe account is going to be the connected account because again we are trying to do a direct charge on the connected account it's also going to have an application fee amount just because oftentimes uh platforms do charge um their merchants a fee for facilitating payments great so we have this payment intent but we're not going to return the entire payment intent if you've seen the accepting a payment video on this very same channel you know that when you um use client-side confirmation when you are using when you're completing the payment on the client side you only need to return the client secret and this is great because it keeps you from potentially exposing information that might be sensitive on the payment intent so we're just going to uh return that client secret [Music] the payment incentive client secret so let's just do that just call this client secret and we'll say payment incent dot client secret and we'll just add a note here and because we're not returning this entire payment content we'll just make it known that we're returning the client secret great so now we are we're uh nearing the end so let's hop back to index.html and we're gonna do here is um we're going to add just one more api call now generally you want to make the payment intent call as early as possible like you might even want to do it as you're generating uh this um this html file but for this example we're just going to do it after we're just going to do it after we've gotten the card the new card for the connected account so let's do that we are going to call the create payment intent uh endpoint get the client secret and then after that we are going to confirm the card payment using stripe.confirm card payment right okay so let's start with this first step so we are going to create the payment intent and this is also going to be fetch to our uh back end but it's not going to contain any arguments because we've already defined the amount and the currency and all that good stuff um there now once we got the client secret um let's just um put it in our messages so let's say [Music] and um let's also announce that we're now that we have the client secret uh the next step is just going to be confirming the payment like we've created the payment intent we've shared the card uh we're ready to accept the payment at this point so let's just announce that we're going to confirm the payment here [Music] okay so we're just going to pass the client secret and this is what i'll let strike know that we're confirming the car payment and what car payment we're confirming and we're also going to pass in the payment method this is the payment method that is going to be charged when we actually confirm the card payment so let's just um also add the payment intent to the debug messages div so that we can take a look there's an error we'll be able to see why uh there's an error if not we'll be able to see that we were successful and verified that uh the payment intent was created against the payment method that was shared and not the payment method that exists on the platform so we're just going to json stringify this uh confirmed card payment this confirmed card payment intent [Music] and this should be it but there's only one way to find out so let's go take a look at our um our app let's see here do believe that i have a bug okay okay let's restart our server and we're just going to do a quick refresh here and we're going to select this mastercard and click pay okay perfect let's see what happens so we got the card we got the card from the platform we created a card for this connected account then we got a new card and shortly afterward we created a payment intent and got our client secret and then we confirmed the payment intent and we can see that this payment intent was successful and it was successful using the one-time token that we used for uh that we got when we shared the platform payment method with the connected account uh but this is great but like let's take a look at it in the dashboard so as i said before when you're using one-time tokens to share payment methods uh from a platform account to a connected account you'll see payment methods in the platform but you won't see payments and then in the connected account you'll see payments but you won't see uh payment methods and this has the benefit of not having more payment methods than you need in the connected account it has the benefit of not requiring you to keep state on what's happening in the platform account with the um slight disadvantage that it does put another api call in the path of making a payment but any case if this is working we should see a payment here and perhaps we did it with the wrong customer so let me just take a look here actually we were using uh i think we were using this customer instead so let's just make another payment because i believe that we may have been using the raw customer there but the uh the essential lessons of what i just showed you uh and the overall pattern remains the same even if in this case because i hardcoded the customer object that we uh made the payment for the wrong customer let's take them take a look here let's take a look here okay so actually i think there's a chance that our payment intent is not actually setting the customer so let's hop back into our server.pi file and sure enough we don't have the customer defined so um [Music] you'll want to remember that when you create a payment intent uh and you want to associate it with a particular customer make sure to define the customer and payments in so now if we make a payment this should be linked to the jenny rosen customer in our connected account dashboard so when we refresh we should we should see a payment here now okay perfect so we see the payment the payment intent it was successful we have payments no payment methods in the connected account and on the platform we have payment methods and no payments thank you so much for joining developer office hours um hopefully this was really really useful sharing payment methods with connect platforms that use direct charges is a really really great feature because it allows you to create almost like a wallet like experience for that end customer where they can really just enter in their payment information once and then they can reuse it across all of the different merchants that might be attacked to your platform when you're building a platform that doesn't have recurring payments that's not using stripe billing using a one-time just-in-time approach to building out to actually sharing payment methods is a really great approach it's very lightweight you don't have to add in additional dashboards you don't have to worry about things like using um webhooks to keep state on what cards get added and detached from the platform customer and if you're using card account updater you don't have to worry about a card being charged for an update across multiple connect accounts in addition to a platform account so this is a really great approach to sharing cards for those platforms that can afford the slight uptick in latency that they might experience if in a future video based on the response of this video we may tackle how to go about attaching uh shared payment methods to the connected account so that they can be reused so if you're interested in learning more about uh the different types of approaches to sharing cards from this approach to an approach where you would save the car and attach it to the customer on the connected account or even approach where you wouldn't do it just in time like we have here but you would proactively attach the cards let us know thanks so much for joining developer office hours i'm charles we'll see you again in another uh episode\", metadata={'source': 'ri07uPos1gs', 'title': 'Cloning payment methods to Stripe Connect

'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] welcome back this segment is going to be about building out product pages with nexjs backed by graph cms so that we can build this headless ecommerce uh platform i think you're really going to like it so let's dive in so we're going to kind of start from scratch we have an empty basically an empty directory here and we're going to create a brand new next js app so we can say npx create next app and we'll say it's like graph mess stripe check out um and yeah i think maybe the very first thing we need to do is just build a page where we can sort of list out our products um sure if that makes sense okay uh and yeah maybe then we can have like a product show page or something that has a button on it that when you click it it will create a checkout session redirect to checkout allow you to purchase and then maybe we can add some uh some web hook stuff yeah i would definitely just let's i would say we we get the um the check out let's get the data down um then maybe i have striped yes um cool and obviously load stripe as well and then because there's a few different elements to this there's the the actual data fetching and building the the pages in nextus then there's also the uh api roots element right because we have that server side requirement um to create a check checkout session with stripe we have to do that on the on the some kind of server environment um so thankfully nextgs has api routes where we can just quickly add a service function to take care of that so i think let's get the data down bill a few you build some product pages and then um yeah i'd stripe check out sounds great oh all right nice okay so we're up we're up and running here we've got pages index.js that we want to go edit all right so i think we can drop into here and maybe we can just delete everything that came with with this new app cool and then yeah so i think we want to we want to like fetch products right as like the very first thing um so maybe we need to like yarn add um is it graphql request yes we're gonna need yes you're gonna need some kind of library or some kind of client to fetch data now because we're because we're probably going to use nextgs kind of data fetching primitives whether that's get server-side props or get static props we don't really need a fully fledged graphical client for the cache aspects we can use something like like graphql requests that you've added okay it's essentially um it's just kind of a a wrapper around fetch right um which interestingly you can just use fetch um with gokul a lot of people don't know that then you you have to like um it's just simply a post request right with kind of like a post request and the body is kind of um just the query is a string stringify version of the query okay um see yeah a lot of people don't don't know that um but you know you get one thing with using something like graphql request is that you get the kind of semantic sugar that um it brings by using graphql so you can use the kind of graphql tag to get a nice um nice indentation on your on your query and things like that so there are benefits to that so yeah i think the way this works right is we just pass it um so from from graph cms yeah uh here so i'll go ahead and get the okay you've got the you've got the link i think it's settings api access this thing yeah i've dropped that in there oh perfect oh wow okay nice um uh okay cool uh and then yeah so then we want to like if we were to just do the same query that you ran from the explorer it would be something like uh maybe products is away graph cms.request and then we just pass in kind of your whole your same your same query right so we would say like products name slug id price like all of that would just go kind of like there and then we should have access to products um that's yeah it's like that easy right like you just gotta like throw in a couple packages and then write a write a little query and then uh yeah exactly you got some json then then the phone begins with the json right okay um yes what's interesting is you've kind of put the you know you've written the query inside of um the react component [Music] which is fine um that would essentially run client side um so on on page load it would run so obviously nextgs has these nice um data fetching primitives or apis for us and you're writing one there against that props okay so that'll essentially run yeah so that that query would now run at build time and build those pages or build that page uh with that data statically for us yeah cool so yeah so this would run this runs at build time not at or this runs server side not client-side because we're we're just taking advantage of this um helper that next gis gives us is that right yeah that runs that runs a build there is a get service side props as well okay okay that that is a server-side request um which has also has its benefits but in this case of building product pages like this where we're not necessarily expecting data to change massively right the speed advantage of building these pages ahead of time is actually much more beneficial so i would say get started props is probably the right uh the right functional fetch and function to use here okay perfect and then now our like we will have access to products because these um like our component that we're exporting here this react component like products will be passed in as sort of like a static json blob on the client when it renders right and then we can use that yeah so inside of get stack props you know we've made our um our query to graph cms and products has been returned and then inside of that function we're actually returning um you know returning a props object and passing products inside of there and what that means is that then that products object is available to us inside of the the props of the actual function component um so yeah at that point you have you'll have access to the products uh it'll be an array okay so then we can do something like this right where we restructure all the stuff from the product and then return like a i don't know uh something maybe just to start let's see if we can get the names to render right yeah so what what happens is although um it's like props in a production build run the build time um this will actually run each time you load the page and when using your next dev okay when you're in practice are you are you seeing like get static props or get server props more commonly used in my use in my usage definitely get started props um because as i said get server side props does have use cases um you would generally use that where perhaps data is more dynamic and so you have to think get service out props that's going to be run each time the page is requested or somebody hits the page that that they're going to it's that's gonna that query all that uh get service out props function is gonna run and it's gonna return the latest data at that time so essentially each time you're it's running on the server and then serving up that generated html from the cdn whereas we've got static props is you're building the html ahead of time serving that statically on a cdn and each person each time that's hit this is getting served the same html so i think in a lot of the work that i'm doing get started props with combined with get static paths and we'll we'll come to that those are the the the two that i'm using most often okay cool it looks like it worked like we're seeing some names here yeah so we're fetching data and putting it on the screen that is like the the story of web development right um so yeah all right we just call it our day now we're done yeah uh should we make it we should probably make this a link right um i think there's like a next thing or is it next link yeah yeah we give it we give it an href right we're saying we don't have to like name this anything different than a normal a tag and the href would go to somewhere like uh product slash and then maybe the slug so that's kind of why we used we're out of the slope to the um to the scale i guess for for prettier page paths urls using a uid um so yeah we'll link it to the product page now so i guess we need to build those okay yeah so yeah if you you can see when i hover at the bottom this would go to like products slash snapback cap because that's the slug right same thing with the hoodie also it kind of got a little gross but just keep it easy keep it easy here give these things some space all right so then um yeah so if we go to pages now um i guess we have to create like a new directory called products and then yeah this was a little weird to me but you you call it um you use square brackets and you say slug.js is that right yeah so what you're doing here yeah is essentially using kind of the file system to declare dynamic routes um so by creating this slug file with the square brackets you're essentially stating that slug is a dynamic parameter and it's going to be used to build um a sub directory of pages uh inside of products so you would use this kind of dynamic routine file system in pair with get static paths in next year's okay what that does is you actually you'll see i want all of my products from my remote cms and then for each product inside of that build this page essentially right okay so you use get static paths with get static props um so do we we i guess we have to probably export a uh get static get static paths and get static like we have to do like uh get static paths and we have to do get static props right in this file exactly okay so let's do let's do that yeah so with get static paths you're generally just fetching the data to build the path in this case the slug okay so that's going to be very similar to this i'm just going to like yeah copy might be worth kind of exporting that graphical client just to its own you can just import i can see that um yeah i wish uh this editor would not lose the graphql or like the query the query formatting but it is what it is uh yeah um so what you can do to actually counter that is actually use the graphql tag so you can do like gql something like that okay i think it's this from [Music] gotcha okay yeah that's what i mean so then you get the um so if you basically kind of it's kind of syntax highlighting for a graphql nice oh i see i see now it's yeah okay now it's not only formatted nicely it's syntax highlighted too cool yeah it's a lot easier when you start doing more complicated things so if you write if you wrote like a query like this where you might have a variable yeah you can see what i mean like the actual syntax highlight is is much more beneficial there okay yeah let's do that with getstatic props because that's going to be a little bit more complex right like we'll have x4 async um get static props and this one is it's more complex because we have to like get a specific one right i guess this is this takes in params maybe and then uh yeah or they come in sort of like this so gets get started paths returns uh the return statement is a little different there it's actually going to return a a params object sorry a paths it's going to return an array of paths or a paths array and inside that um it expects params so the slug in that case okay yeah and and then this is going to be just going to say like uh grams slug like that exactly okay cool and then i've seen i've seen this fallback uh false what does this part do fall back false yes you you have to provide the fallback key and what that does is it's essentially so it's gonna tell nextgs whether or not to fall back to rendering this or building this page dynamically so for example if i was to write a query up here for example that only returned three products of the five in my catalog and somebody went to the path for one of those products that wasn't built if fallback uh is there fallback is true and that will essentially then go off and rebuild that uh on the fly whoa okay gotcha so say for example you have products one through five i've written a query that's queries for products one through three and we build static pages for those with get started profs props if somebody then went to products slash five using fallback true would actually go off and build that page dynamically so it would run the same request uh the same get static props request and build that page on the fly and then that would be served uh in the cdn to everybody else um down here i think we just say like away graph uh cms dot um request i always want to say fetch uh yeah instead of request it's like uh yeah it's it's yeah i guess yeah i mean they've they've probably it is essentially a semantic wrapping around the request library i guess yeah or fetch libraries so it's probably for a while then here we want we want like a single product but we can't just say product or we can't just say like product where because we want to pass in like params right so we have to define a new query is that right yes you'll need to to write a query like you are and then actually kind of define the graphql variable like so yeah and then that will be available to you and then the dot sign is a graphical variable right and then that that like ties to something down here right where you say like or actually this is we want all of these to be slug right um yes we're going to find by slug yeah that may be string type yeah yeah so the second argument so in the graphql request um function uh the first argument is the query or the mutation and the second argument is is the variables uh so yeah that's exactly right okay cool and then i guess on this page we probably want name uh slug price images is that uh images is gonna be something like like that right to query the sub like the asset is going to have a url property is that correct that's right yeah so when there are subfields like so you you kind of yeah you have to um use the hash or the essentially and specify the subfields um so url will be useful um if we're going to use the next image component probably also want the width and the height of each asset all right i'll get the idea as well just because um sure you know react uh expects oh too sorry the idea of the images oh because yeah it's gonna want um because if we bump over those react expects a unique key so it's i always just ask for the id because i know it's there okay cool so then this this is a git static prop so this one returns props right return yes switch points at product something like that and then this whole thing is going to export default and then this is going to get a product uh yeah like that and then yes the outcome of get static props is is available inside of your react functional props functional component probes okay so let's see if that is doing anything yet and uh graphql is not a function uh it's that's my fault it's okay i think it might be um the import gql from graphql maybe no it's it's yeah it's that but from there oh is it okay yeah oh okay maybe this gql thing can we just like see if if we remove that that helps i know that shouldn't matter but query product page query pass and slug are we is params is this param slug for sure or is that going to be nested somewhere some other way there okay so now we see test okay so then change if we change this to is that name okay it's working i don't know what happened that was weird actually no we changed gql uh i think i think what it might have been was that we were exporting an async function here okay also they prefer to kind of do okay cool so now we've got like something showing up on the page um can we yeah i would love to see some of the new next.js image stuff so um i haven't i haven't worked with this before is it it's just an image tab the image tag that comes from from next yeah so it's a [Music] next image here it's just a component and it's essentially a drop-in replacement for the html element issue an image element um so it accepts very similar props src width height um but will kind of bring a lot of progressive enhancement with it lazy lawn adaptive uh asset loading depend on screen size that kind of stuff okay should we pull off like the very first image of the product yeah they've only got there's only one so i've only added one for each product so we could just i guess you could just map over it or you could you could just kind of destructure it if you want yeah that yeah that'll work okay and then this is like that url right and then i would have done that if you were kind of you could have done that if you were mapping over the product images over here yeah um i think that would have been more readable um yeah so i think i know the issue here um the issue is gonna be essentially we actually have to do a bit of configuration for next image to work okay in the root of the project we just need a next.config.js file and just do a module exports and it's image i believe could be images and it's like domains um which is an array and then i think it's our cds media.graphcms.com so that's essentially saying we're safe to load assets from this this url this url okay i see nice yeah okay so it's good to see if i guess it's good to kind of uh safe safe list them allow them sure and then i saw like that we could specify device sizes and image sizes are those going to like kind of work out of the box does it have some defaults that will yes there is a default configuration that will apply and it's kind of the most common kind of breakpoints you would expect so yeah those we haven't overwritten those just by kind of adding this um this config parameter um those those defaults will still apply so you don't need to worry about that so much i think i did this import wrong this should be like this maybe yeah that's right yeah mix that up like every single day i mix up like yeah yeah it's that's yeah that's a default expo boom product page with an image nice okay beautiful look at that logo it's so pretty i want this hat i know i don't even have that hat i have to go i might have to go buy from the swag store right after this you know when it's uh i actually need to enable the fulfillment yeah doesn't actually do anything yet uh we just kind of set up with test uh test keys of stripe we went back into graph cms like is this this height and width i assume is set in graph cms yeah yeah so that's just the the metadata of the image so let's just pull from the the actual asset oh got it that's i don't have to specify that at all it's just kind of pulled from the the image details i don't i don't really know enough about images to okay but all right so that's how you can uh build some product pages out we're going to go into the next section here the in the video that follows this we'll show you how to redirect to stripe checkout i think you're really going to like it\",

rails the web framework how it works how we use rails as a base for some stripe developer office hours episodes and also in the stripe samples a collection of github repositories demonstrating integrations with many stripe products you may be just getting started and are curious about how to build an application from scratch to take your first online payment this episode will cover basics to help you get started quickly with ruby on rails if you already have a back end set up and are comfortable adding new routes and are now looking to add a stripe integration you may want to check out other office hours episodes where we show how to integrate specific stripe products and features similarly if you're looking for an introduction to a more like minimal web framework in ruby i'd recommend taking a look at sinatra we have another episode covering getting started with sinatra so why why rails rails is an opinionated feature-rich and popular web framework it includes everything needed to create a database-backed web application demos created with rails allow us to leverage rails conventions and the built-in orm or object relational model to build these data backed demos and they also help us demonstrate things like csrf or cross-site request forgery authentication background jobs sending emails and stuff like that so features that are more challenging to show with minimal web frameworks because while they're possible in a framework like sinatra or express you have to use third-party libraries to solve these same problems if you're already working with a more minimal framework like sinatra or express the same fundamentals we cover in this episode will apply but are implemented a little bit differently across a bigger more opinionated code base today we'll cover setting up a basic front end with the standard built-in html.erb files in another future episode we'll go into more detail about how to set up a front-end framework like react to work with rails it might be helpful to watch and refer to some other episodes before watching this one namely the introduction to the stripe cli as a quick agenda for today what we're going to cover is configuring your api keys and an initializer to get set up we're going to show how to set up a basic front end with a static html file and stripe.js installed and we'll show uh you know working with these dependencies in the gem file implementing some basic routes and connecting those to the front end so you can make requests from your front end to the back end and finally we'll wrap up with a web hook handler or how to set up your web hooks controller so i'm going to start from scratch here in the terminal i'm going to use the rails new command to create a brand new rails application here we're going to call it office hours rails so my preferred database is postgres but rails has several flavors of database that it supports like sqlite mysql etc etc so i'm going to say rails new office hours dash dash database is equal to postgresql i'm going to say dash t to skip tests by default rails uses mini test while i prefer r spec i can also say dash dash skip skip turbo links and dash dash skip listen turbo links is for this is preventing the installation of turbo links preventing the configuration of some dependencies that uh work with the listen gem which has a couple of issues i've noticed with some unix environments so we're just going to skip that okay so this is going to take a moment to install all the dependencies and create all the files we want and some front-end assets okay great our install of the new rails application is complete we're gonna change directory here into office hours rails and i'm just gonna open this up so that we can look at the directory structure so here in uh in the app directory this is where all of your application code will live assets is your javascript css files channels is for um action cable this is if you're doing sort of like real time communication with the front and back end controllers is where your controllers will live rails is an mvc framework model view controller so this is where your controllers live helpers are sort of like mix-ins that you can use with your views and your controllers we probably will not use helpers as part of any office hours episodes you can put some javascript here in this javascript directory um we'll talk much more about this when we talk about front-end frameworks like rails or i'm sorry react or vue or angular etc jobs is where we put the classes responsible for running background tasks so this is like the background jobs directory mailers is for classes that are responsible for sending emails models is our data models the classes that allow us to interact with the database but often times people will put you know plain old ruby objects into these model files and then finally we have a views directory with some template files these are html.erb templates that is embedded ruby on top of html moving on down the list here we've got a config we're going to talk about initializers but in here you'll also notice a master dot key file this file allows us to encrypt and decrypt the credentials file we're going to talk about credential management because we need to set our stripe api keys we also have down here the database which just contains a seeds.rb file common to edit that we probably will not look at or work with anything else that's in here just know that it's there and it's useful and you might encounter some need to change some files elsewhere but for the purposes of developer office hours we're mostly going to be working within that app directory and kind of configuring our initializers and setting up some some basic routes controllers and models let's use the credential management to set our api key we can set an environment variable here called editor and i'm going to set that to vi um this could be your editor of choice visual studio code atom sublime emacs whatever but then the command we run is rails credentials colon edit and this will rails credentials colon edit will decrypt that credentials file this is a just encrypted yaml file so we're going to decrypt it using the master key and this will allow us to edit the yaml and when you save it it'll be re-encrypted so here i can say stripe secret key is my secret key you can find your api keys in the stripe dashboard and we have some episodes about authentication uh where we go in more depth here but generally we'll have three things here a secret key public key and a web hook secret and those are these are sort of my test keys this is how we set up the api keys for the demo your setup may vary and could support multiple environments for for instance production and development or similar so for demos we're always going to just set these test keys at the top level in the yaml block like so all right now if i close this file and save it that will re-encrypt the file so that we have some encrypted credentials next we want to install some dependencies which we can do by opening the gem file which is at the root of the application here at the bottom i'm going to add obviously gem stripe this will install the stripe ruby gem the ruby bindings in the development group i also like to use pry rails and annotate which are a couple of helpful gems for just working in development and then finally we're gonna un comment the bcrypt the bcrypt gem because in some demos we will use bcrypt for encrypting for instance passwords okay we can close the gem file and run bundle install that will install our dependencies when you run a rails application it'll first load the framework in any gems for the application so the gems that we just loaded those will be loaded after the application is loaded then it'll load these files called initializers they live in config initializers you can generally use initializers to hold configuration settings that should be made after all the framework and gems are loaded so for instance setting your api key so here in config initializers there's a directory with several initializers already we want to add a new one called stripe stripe.rb and in here we will globally set our api key to configure the stripe ruby client that way when we make api requests to the stripe api using stripe ruby they will all be authenticated with this globally set api key okay we do this by or we can access the credentials that we set in that yml file by going through rails.application.credentials.stripe because that was the top level key and then we need to index into this with uh the name of the key that was underneath stripe so remember recall that it said stripe and then underneath that we had secret key like this this is what the yaml file looked like so here when we say rails.application.credentials that accesses the file at the top level dot stripe gets us into this level and then by passing in the this symbol here for secret key that'll allow us to pull out the stripe secret key and set that api key so now we can close that all right so at this point we should be able to make api calls to the stripe api so running rails console or simply rails c will give us an interactive shell where we can experiment with objects that are loaded inside of the rails application so the stripe ruby gem should be loaded our api key should be set and we should be able to access and work with the stripe api directly from our terminal so here we can say something like stripe price dot list and you'll see that we get back a list of prices that are connected to my stripe account you can also say something like stripe customer dot create and pass in an email address jenny rosen at example.com i'm not sure why i capitalized the j and are there in that email but you'll see that we do get a response back from the stripe api we just created a brand new customer so we're interacting directly with the stripe api in the in the terminal here in this interactive shell uh through the rails console okay so it looks like uh all of our api keys are configured we've got our dependencies installed everything is working we're able to talk to stripe the final dependency we'll install is stripe.js in rails application there's a there's a file called application.html.erb where the master html layout file is generally the file which wraps all other views and is where we want to install stripe.js so let me show you where that belongs where that lives under apps views layouts there's application.html.erb technically we can install stripe.js anywhere as long as it's loaded before we try to use it it is best practice to load stripe.js on every single page that's why we want to put it in this application html erb i like to put it in the head above these other javascript include tags so i'm going to just add this here this way if we write any javascript in application.js for instance then stripe.js will be loaded first i have also seen folks cut this and put it down below so that it's executing after the body loads this is another practice that i've seen before then you'll notice that when we create other views this yield command is where those like partial templates will be rendered into so this is where we call yield and where most templates are going to render into so first for office hours we typically have this standard html that we put in all templates and that allows us to have a little bit of structure and shape and then that works along with some demo css that we have for all office hours episodes this is excellent now we have like a rough outline of what an application with dependency installed and stripe ruby configured stripe.js configured for us to begin making api calls so next we're going to create a controller and some associated views to see how to handle requests we can say rails generate controller or we can even simplify this to rails g controller orders and say no helper and no assets generally you'll have a model and a controller that kind of have a similar name so if you have an order model you have an orders controller if you have a posts model you'll have a posts controller if you have a customer model you might have a customers controller this is going to generate a new file with a class that's responsible for receiving and responding to requests specifically about orders so rails applications generally follow a very strong convention to help developers build applications faster controllers typically have one or many standard actions but can also have custom routes so let's open up this file and talk about what those standard actions are we have index show new create edit update and destroy okay so index this is where we list items so in this case we're going to be returning a list of orders generally here we return a single item here we return a form for creating an item create is where we actually receive a post request and actually create the item edit returns a form for updating an item and update is where we will receive the post request to change or the put put request patch request to change modify or update an existing item and then destroy just deletes an item okay so this is generally the way that standard actions are set up in rails index new show create edit update destroy so we have this class called orders controller and when we add these actions to the controller in order to route requests to the right controller action we have to update another file called routes.rb it's this configuration file which contains the list of path and controller action mappings so here we have routes.rb this is what it generally looks like to start with there's an entire dsl or domain specific language for defining the routes we're generally going to use this method called resources so you can say resources orders and this is going to create 7 standard path to controller action mappings so by saying resources orders here we will get the orders index so we can say for instance actually i'm going to pull up a graphic that helps explain this a bit more okay so this is in the official rails documentation you see that here it's saying resources photos remember that our controller is called order the orders controller and so when in the demo here it says resources photos and that creates these seven routes a route called slash photos which receives when receiving requests that are using the get http verb those will route to the index action on the photos controller in our case we have resources orders so if you go to slash orders you make a get request to slash orders it will call the order controller index action and return a list of orders that's what it's supposed to be just conventionally separately if you if you do slash order slash new or slash photo new that will be a get request that hits the new route and generally returns a form to create a new order or a new photo we have the same thing with post so if you send a post request to slash photos it will use that create method to create a new photo get with photos slash id so this is like photo slash one photo slash two similarly with orders order slash one order slash two that will use the show method in the photos controller the show action in the photos controller get for slash photo slash id edit this again returns the form for editing or updating the photo this will use the edit method on the controller patch if you send a patch or put request to photo id this will update that photo sending a delete to photo slash id that will destroy that photo so this convention follows for orders and for our controller because we named our controller orders controller and we used this method called resources orders we are able to um out of the box we get these seven methods that we can use and these are the paths to make the requests that will map to those controller actions let's go back to our orders controller here and add a method that will handle requests to the index so if we just say maybe like orders is a list of 1 2 3 4 and 99 and then we say render json of orders this is saying when we receive a request to slash orders because we have we've mapped this in our routes file when we receive a request to slash orders call this index method by default right now we're not going to do anything with the incoming request other than just know that we were asked for a list of orders and then down here we can call render and in this case the the the format that we're rendering back is json and we're passing just an array this array of orders oftentimes if you're working with active record this will be orders equals order dot all and that will fetch all the orders and then return the json for those but for our example right now we don't actually have a model yet so we are simply going to return the json for those orders all right so we've talked a lot about getting our application configured but we haven't yet started the application so we can use rails s or rails server to start the application this will boot up the app by default it's going to use puma for this version of rails and now it's listening on port 3000 so if we went to the browser and went to localhost 3000 and refresh the page you'll get this yay you're on rails sort of default template this is coming from index.html that's in the public directory generally you pretty pretty quick after installing and setting up rails we're going to go back into that routes routes.rb file and configure it so that when we make requests to the root route we receive a different html template so right now if we go to slash orders though we get back the json and uh that's that's all looking great so this is how we can add a method to the server which returns some json in this case orders now if we wanted to we could modify this so that it was maybe it's a list of like keys or uh you know maybe it's an object here maybe we have two objects you know thing is stuff okay all right so now if we come back over here and refresh the page all that json is going to come back just as json in the javascript object uh all right so that is looking that's looking okay it's looking alright so hopefully that helps helps map the methods that are on a controller to the routes file the next thing i wanted to do was create a new controller and this is going to be a very special controller which only handles requests that are coming in for the root route just for the slash so i'm going to say rails g controller static pages i'm going to name the view root so when you're generating a controller you can pass a list of names after the the name of the controller and these will be created as methods on the controller they'll also be created as routes in the routes file so that's that can be that can be helpful no assets okay so we're creating another file here called static pages and it will have a method called root you'll notice that there was also a file here in app view static pages called root.html that we will that we will uh play with in a bit um so let's go to the routes file you'll notice that it added this get request for static pages root we're going to delete that and add root um static pages root root is another special method in the domain specific language for specifying routes where you are just it you can only call it one time and it's just for the the slash so if i remove um orders here i should return the static pages root okay so we've got our we have the root of our application here living at static pages in app view static pages root let's head over here and update this so that our header says developer office hours static pages root so this is what the the the file that was generated because we used the rails g controller static pages and we passed in that root method here we're going to say developer office hours so now we have this root file if we refresh the page you'll see developer office hours that all looks great and this is working as expected now let's go back into the static pages root file and make a button that when clicked will send a post request to create a new order rails g model order and for now let's say that it just has a a stripe id and a status okay so here we can use the again rails generate and this time we're generating a model not a controller so we say rails g model order and then we can pass in all the fields that we want so by default you can also specify a type so if the stripe id was an integer we could specify integer you can also specify string text boolean there's several different ways that you can specify the default is just string so stripe ids are strings statuses are also strings we might have maybe a paid at which is a date time so we can we can do this when we hit enter this will create two things this will create the class file for an order in order.rb and it will also create a migration a database migration for us called create orders the create orders migration is again a dsl or a domain specific language for writing migration so this is going to convert this create table method is going to convert from ruby into the database manipulation language code so the the code that will modify the database by creating a table or updating a table or removing a column or you can create a table called orders it's going to have three column or three columns that we've specified the stripe id status and paydat and then by saying t.timestamps that will add a created at and updated that field automatically for us and rails will keep track of all of those things so by default there's actually a third or a final thing that's created for us by default and that is an id it's an autumn incrementing integer id by default and so all of that will be created for us just by specifying the table like so another thing that we might do is say add index and then you set you pass the name of the table and the column that you want to index on stripe id it might be that we want to look up orders really really frequently with the stripe id and this will by adding an index this will speed up the lookup by making the database more performant we can also add other other options here so we can specify that this should be unique by saying unique true so this this is a pattern that you might see in office hours episodes okay i'm going to close that file and the way that we run this is we say rake db migrate which will run the migration against our database and create a new table in the database so this created a brand new order table i'm not going to go into too much detail about active record but i do want to go back to our orders controller and update this so that rather than rendering the list of items like that we're saying orders is order.all for the index and that should be a good spot for us to start okay so now what we have is uh in our orders controller let's also add a create method here so we're going to say at order is equal to order dot new order params if the order was saved then we want to render the json for the order otherwise we want to render the errors okay so this is super simple you might be wondering where this order params thing came from it doesn't exist yet so we're going to define it down here generally it's a private method on the controller order params this is again just a convention to name it order underscore or like because we're in an orders controller we're going to or name it order underscore preamp if we were in a photos controller we would call it photos underscore params so here we're going to say params.require order dot permit status and paid at and stripe id what we're doing here is specifying which parameters are allowed to be set on an order when we create it so this is how we sort of this is called strong parameters if you want to look up more about the the rails framework and how it's set up this is called strong params for now i'm just gonna sort of wave my hand and let you know that this this is something that you want to do generally this will um mean that the the json or the request that's coming in looks like this order points at and then that's what this required does is requires that there's a top level order key in the params requires a top level order key and then permit status is like paid paid at is some time stamp and the stripe id is you know some payment intent id uh possibly right this this is what the shape of the incoming params could look like so this is uh this is allowing that to be permitted now if we did not want the user to be able to set the stripe id for some reason maybe that's something or we didn't want them to set the status maybe we don't want a user to be able to pass in the status from the front end to automatically mark an order as paid then what we could do is remove status from what's allowed to be set here and instead set it a different way so we can set it by just calling order.status directly on the order method all right so now that we have this order create method let's try to create an order let's try to create an order object so from our front end um in static pages root i want to add a button and for now i'm just going to call it create order and i'm going to add a script tag just in line here where we're going to grab reference to the button so here i'm using document.queryselector and passing in the css selector so the hashtag says refer to these the html element with its id being equal to button or btn and then i'm going to say on click of this button create an order so i'm going to send a post request to slash orders right because our orders we have that slash orders is where we're receiving post requests so a post to slash orders will result in the execution of the orders controller create method because we use this resources orders and the next thing we want to do is we will just we'll just console.log the data that we get back so here we want to pass we want to pass in maybe a status of paid we want to pass in maybe paid at one two three four five six seven eight nine actually let's see df now okay sure that's a little better and then maybe we want to pass in uh the stripe id is pi pi123 okay so this this will make a post request from the client using ajax or using the fetch api when that request gets to the server the server is going to handle it in the orders controller the create method of the orders controller will execute a new order will be created and then saved to the database and we're going to receive the json for the order back then the client will resolve the promise and the data will be this order object let's give it a whirl so if we go back to the browser and click refresh we'll see a new button here and if we open the the developer tools which we can do by right-clicking and going to inspect we can see in the console so there's several tabs here super super helpful if we go to sources we can see the content of the javascript that we have just written if you click on the gutter so on any of the numbers here in the gutter that'll create a break point that will allow us to kind of like inspect the code as it's executing so i'm adding a breakpoint on line 25 because that is right inside of the function callback to the click the click event listener the add event listener method as soon as we click on this button this function should execute so we should hit this breakpoint so when i click on create order it does and it's broke you know the the javascript debugger broke on that line i removed the breakpoint by clicking the line again now i'm going to add another breakpoint to line 39 because the next step here is going to make a post request to this to slash orders to create an order object and then we should get back the order but i've i've skipped one step so it's going to error out but let's see okay so we got an error it says unexpected token here in the console unexpected token uh square bracket at position whatever we got a 422 unprocessable entity that's the the http status code is 422. so if we look at the network tab and click on orders we see this big red error that says action controller invalid authenticity token so in rails they protect from cross site request forgery with this concept of an authenticity token so every request every post request that's received by default should have this authenticity token now there's two things we can do number one we can disable this authenticity token checking not recommended because then you lose your csrf protection which is helpful for preventing fraud preventing people from you know ddosing you preventing several different things just it's it's really important and really common to have csrf checking on a production web application so you want to have it generally turned on the other way we can get around this is by passing the authenticity token in the request that we're sending along so authenticity token is form authenticity token okay so there uh if we include this authenticity underscore token parameter when we're making our request and its value is set to um some string that is available by calling the form authenticity token rails helper method because we're in html.erb we have access to this csrf token and we're able to just put that directly in the code i'm also noticing that i forgot to nest these under order so i'm going to add that too so order is these things okay so all right let's let's try it again if we refresh the page and we go back to sources let's take a look here you'll notice that the authenticity token this string is now filled out right here okay so the authenticity token is again part of preventing csrf i think you can also put it in the header but generally i just put it directly in the request body because rails has this convention of separating out the content that you're sending to create an object as uh by nesting it underneath that key so let's click this button again and see what happens we again have an error this time it's a 500 okay so let's look at the network tab go to orders undefined method or local variable order params order params oh i misspelled it okay so let's go back to our orders controller okay refresh the page click create again all right so now we're in the successful callback here and you'll see that we did get our order back um what's interesting is that uh or like the thing that's of note is that now we have a created at and an updated ad that are full um full timestamps so this was they created that updated at an id are all managed directly by rails and were created for us so now we have this concept of of an order still this order has nothing to do with stripe we are just simply showing how to do crud how to uh make requests from the front end to the back end and vice versa so here we have created in order the next thing i want to do is show how we might fetch orders so let's go back to our static pages root and from here we can add another um some more some more logic here at the bottom so before we do that let's see so at the top of this page i'm going to add a ul with the id of orders and it'll just be empty initially because what we're going to do is fetch the orders using ajax using this fetch api and then we'll populate the list of orders and show just the id and the created at in the list okay so at the bottom of our script here i'm going to grab reference to that orders ul and next i'm going to make a fetch request this time it's a get request so by default fetch if it's a get request you do not need to specify the method or the headers or body or whatever so we're going to make this get request to slash orders and we expect that the data we get back is a list of orders and we'll say something like orders dot for each order and we want to create maybe orders ul dot inner html plus equals um some li uh yeah we'll just we're just kind of playing around here so this is going to be ordered id and from ordered created at and then we'll close the li and this should sort of build up that orders ul as it's going so let's see so if i if we hit refresh here uh we got a 500 uh cool all right so then go to the network tab we come to let's see clear clear let's make sure we're working with the same stuff here so we hit right when the page loads we should be hitting the orders the orders endpoint as a get request and we did and we did get back a list of orders here it looks like those did not actually populate this ul though so let's add some breakpoints here so when we refresh the page this document.queryselector is running let's see the orders ul it seems like it has an id so we're going to fetch orders and then when we get into here for each order orders is a list okay um and then what is order yeah order has that id so enter is it oh you know what i think this might be capitalized all right let's see uh yeah okay cool um so created at all right so refresh the page here and now we have one that's the id of the order from and this is you know the date so this is great if we click create order again uh and then refresh the page we should have a second order i thought uh we're getting errors here what are our errors um record not unique ah the stripe id has to be unique okay so um let's say our stripe id is now um i don't know new date let's see what happens okay so i think we created an order refresh the page okay so now we've got a new order from that date create an order refresh the page we've got order number five all right so this looks like it's totally working um as expected that's kind of how you how you can both send and receive data from the back end that's kind of really the basics for getting started with making requests in rails and kind of all you need to know in terms of the basics for working with rails for developer office hours except for web hooks so let's move on to web hooks last and we'll we'll wrap up by demonstrating how you can work with with web hook with a web hooks controller okay so a web hook is a notification or it's a combination of a bunch of different tools so a web hook consists of a web hook endpoint and web hook notification so when events happen on your stripe account you can be notified of those so a web hook endpoint is this route on your server to which stripe will send post requests we know from creating our orders controller that we can create a create method a method called create in the orders controller and that will receive post requests and that allows us to create order objects similarly with web hooks we can create a webhooks controller and in the create action of our webhooks controller we can receive post requests so i'll say railsg controller webhooks no helper no assets and we don't need any views users do not see any part of a web hook a web hook is purely for some third party to send you a notification so if you go to our web hooks controller here and add a create method this is where we're going to receive post from stripe or another third party okay we need we also need to go to our routes.rb file and set up a a method so we can receive posts to slash webhooks to webhooks create similarly you might see us use resources web hooks only create these two are one in the same so by specifying only that will say only create the routes or only create the paths that will map to one single method that way people you know there's no way to like retrieve web hooks there's no way to see a single instance of an event created from a web hook or similar so what's nice about using resources if is if in the future you decided that you wanted a way to maybe destroy a web hook or something then you could add delete or destroy here or show or something so you could extend this by using resources and just easily adding a new method to that to this this only list all right so we are receiving post requests from stripe here we've got our route set up the way that this works is when we receive a post request from stripe we will generally automate something so when um here there's an entire list of event types here so let's take a look at the event types so under in the api reference under types of events you'll see a huge list of possible event types that are going to happen or be fired on your event so account.updated is an example a balance being available is an example one of the most common is checkout session completed this is a very common webhook event tie for people to automate based on because this is when someone has successfully paid through stripe checkout the stripe hosted checkout page there's several several other events that you might listen for event types that you might listen for and automate based on so for instance you might send an email when an invoice is paid these are the types of things that you would set up web hooks for so we are now going to we're going to build this create method and i'm actually going to start from the web hook controller or the web hook documentation here under check signatures i'm going to go down to the ruby code this code is written in like for sinatra this post do this is for sinatra but the code is quite easy to translate so we'll i'll just copy this and then we can work with this so what does this look like all right so at the beginning we are getting the payload we want to use request.body.read so that we have the most raw version of the payload that's coming in the reason is that we want to do some signature verification of the web hook so down here when we say stripe web hook construct event we pass in the payload a signature header so in the post request that comes from stripe it's going to have this stripe signature in the header and that signature is a a inc when you combine your web hook signing secret with the signature that came from stripe you can double check to make sure that this post request didn't come indeed come from stripe and not some malicious third party who is just kind of sending post requests to your web hook endpoint so our endpoint secret is available in rails credentials under webhook secret because we said this earlier okay if uh deserializing the event fails because it's invalid json we want to render json back to stripe and say error or message e with a 400 status code anything that's not 200 including redirects will result in a failed web hook event from stripes perspective and they will retry we'll retry with exponential back off for several days okay so this is this is where we're extracting the entire raw payload from the request body then we are pulling out the stripe signature header from the request headers request.n allows us to access the headers then we are looking in the rail application credentials for the webhook signing secret that we set earlier here we're setting event we're creating a variable called event and setting it equal to nil so that when we're done with this begin rescue end block we still have access to the event the scope variable scoping in ruby is block block scoping and when you enter a begin block uh the we would lose reference to this variable if we didn't have you know reference in the parent scope so we create the we create event equals nil here so that we have access to the event after we're done with this begin rescue and try catch block okay at the very bottom this is very common we'll have a case statement a case when or a switch where we check um we we switch based on the event type so we're basically saying like if the event type is payment intent succeeded run this block if the event type is payment method attached run this block etc etc so you can really easily add several different event types that you want to listen for let's call that good and then finally we want to render json back that says maybe message just success and that will be rendered back to stripe remember that the the only way that this endpoint is called is directly by stripe one of the things that we talked about earlier was csrf protection or cross-site request forgery protection and uh recall that we passed in the form authenticity token when we were making an ajax call from our front end to our back end so that we knew and we kind of like had confidence that the request the post request that was incoming was from a site that we owned because we rendered that form authenticity token directly into the page and that authenticity token is going to change every time the page loads so because there is no page that's loading on stripes server when they're making a request to our web hooks controller we need to disable csrf protection on the webhooks controller so we can do that with skip before action verify authenticity verify authenticity token so there's this concept of before actions and after actions and rails which are methods that will run sort of before your method is encountered and after your method is encountered and by saying skip before action here we're we're calling this class method at the very top level and passing in the the symbol for the before action that we want to skip over so verify authenticity token is basically just disabling csrf so disable um csrf token checking okay next we want to we're going to use the stripe cli stripe listen dash dash forward to uh localhost 3000 slash hook looks so the stripe cli is a tool for building and testing web hooking or stripe integrations we have a really handy tool in stripe listen that allows you to set up a direct connection between your stripe account and your local machine so that when events happen on your stripe account they're forwarded to your local running web server so we are going to just leave this running in a tab in our terminal and this will form a direct connection in practice when you go to production you'll want to go create a webhook endpoint in the stripe dashboard that points to your production url but in test mode and in development this is really the best way to uh to test and build your web hooks so what we've got going on here is we have this direct connection when an event fires on our stripe account it's going to trigger this listener which will forward a post request to our web hooks controller because again this slash web hooks when we receive a post request to slash webhooks our routes.rb file has specified resources webhooks which matches this webhook's controller name and knows to call the create method so we've got all this set up let's open another tab and there's a separate stripe cli test tool called trigger so i can say stripe trigger checkout dot session dot completed and this will fire several api calls which will result in a checkout.session.completed event firing so several event several other events will also fire so we're going to get checkout session completed payment um you know payment method attached etc etc so if we look in this is the listen tab the tab where we have our stripe listener set up you can see several different events happened here including this checkout session completed event so these are all being forwarded to our web hook endpoint you can see that it was a post request to localhost 3000 webhooks here was the event id that was fired and we got a 200 status code in the response and it tells you like when it when it happened so if we then look in the the server logs for our running application you'll see that we receive these post requests for localhost at this time and it's being processed by the webhooks controllers create method as xml is just the default and here was all the data for the event that was fired from stripe and this allows us to automate things like sending emails or you know pulling from inventory or printing shipping labels or things like that i think i'm gonna wrap it there you should now be uh fully equipped to at least follow along in some of the stripe developer office hours episodes where we use ruby on rails uh and uh yeah some hopefully you were able to take away some best practices in terms of where to set your api key how to manage credentials and a couple other tips and tricks around uh how i work with ruby on rails so please if you have any questions comments concerns reach out we're on irc in the free no network in the stripe channel also happy to chat on twitter at stripe dev or at cjav underscore dev all right until next time\",

you get a lot of payment functionality for your efforts for example uh checkout supports digital wallets like apple pay and google pay if you're taking card payments in europe uh checkout is sca ready so um stripe will take care of 3ds authentication for you um you get access to many different types of local payment methods like fpx in malaysia or ideal in the netherlands to name a few and all of that localized into more than 25 languages and optimized for screen sizes from desktop all the way down to mobile welcome to developer office hours my name is matt ling i'm a developer support engineer here at stripe and in today's integration we're going to build um checkout integration using sepa debit so let's take a quick look um at an example of what we're going to build here we have um my store and if i click to purchase this photo print we'll be redirected over to stripe where we enter some payment information i'm going to grab a valid iban since we're using sepa okay um add some billing information and click to pay and we should be redirected back out to the start page okay so let's um let's build that um okay so i'll start out by bootstrapping a ruby and sinatra project using the stripe cli uh using the developer office hours template and we'll call it checkout i'll choose ruby and then we get a basic project um to start with okay i have some prepared html and css which i'll check copy into the clients directory client directory brother okay um okay i'm gonna remove this uh index.html file which we don't need okay so on the root um i'm going to render the index erb here we can say this is a sepa um zebra debit okay um let's start the server okay um then we can go ahead and we should see yeah so this is the same index uh erb that we had before and when i click on the button will be post we post rather to the redirect route and so i can go ahead so this is the first thing we need to do is actually create the checkout session for your customer post direct and so that's going to be a stripe checkout session create and this takes an options hash um the mode is going to be payment um because checkout supports uh one-time payments but also starting subscriptions which is really useful um the payment method types um in this case we are going to use sepadebus um so we definitely need to provide um an array of line items so normally you would dynamically generate this list based on a cart or something similar [Music] all right so we have a price and i'm going to grab the price i've already created on the dashboard but i'll go and grab that now and quantity let's just purchase one um all right so price and i'm going to put it into the environment variables or we can just hard code it why not um okay jump into the dashboard so here's my photo print and i've got um photopine product and it has a euro price of 10 books 10 euros um okay um actually no let's put this into the environment variables because the code that is hosted on um github will have a placeholder for you um so this example by the way is uh hosted at github under developer office hours and in stripe samples so you can go ahead and actually follow along if you'd like to um all right price okay oops i'll grab it here again okay um right and nice okay so that's our price configured um we also need to give it a success url let's come back to localhost to the um the start page um i could also just say like success that's true the same goes for canceling if the user cancels out of the checkout session okay just do a double check price and the mode is payment we're using sap debit the line items and success and cancel url okay cool so what we can do is uh tell the logs for the account and and see if i should posting that to posting back to the uh redirect route actually creates yeah um it's line items plural let's try that again okay that does seem to have worked and here we can see okay the log set yeah http 200. um it's been created okay um so the next thing to do is now that we have a valid session we need to redirect the user to um to strive using strike.js so let's save the session id into a variable and we're going to render then the redirect view yeah redirect.erb i'm gonna steal a line from in here nice um and here we need to initialize drive.js and the publishable key is stored in the environment variables let's get rid of that okay okay let's try and then we redirect to check out passing the session id that we just um created [Music] a session this one okay so if we restart the server and repost this form yeah we end up on checkout cool so we can provide this information here okay and pay and because um sepa debit is an asynchronous payment method asynchronous meaning um we don't immediately know the outcome of the payment we need to listen out on a web book endpoint um to know when uh when a payment either has succeeded or failed um so let's jump into the back end again um and the developer office hours template um gave us this web hook for free um but the most important part um that's going on here is uh this construct event method where we provide the raw body of the um post event the webhook signing secret and then the header that and stripe sends along um and here um the the header the header is recalculated the signature's recalculated and compared and if that checks out then we know that the event came from stripe um so and here for we are checking the event types and we are essentially interested in three the checkout session completed so you know that somebody um checked out uh check out completed and we're also interested in two others um namely if the payment fails succeeds or fails um that happens async async payment succeeded okay we can report that too payment so exceeded um let's copy that actually and failed okay so more uh here's where you would um finally provision your service or um complete an order because you know that the uh debit actually went through and or here you could for example contact your customer to let them know that um something's gone wrong okay let's just um we're going to leverage the stripe cli again to listen out for um events i'm going to forward them to this webhook endpoint okay so let's go and check out again i use this ipad again and then if we inspect the events that are created we can see here at the checkout session the check i completed and then eventually we should see that the um the payment succeeds and that's what's happened here yeah so that was another short and sweet integration with stripe um it really is kind of a testament to the simplicity and power of check out how easy it is to integrate with stripe and add new payment methods um if you have any questions comments or feedback please do contact us we'll be thrilled to hear from you you can get us on support.stripe.com or jump into our irc channel on freenode and so yeah thanks again for joining us and until next time stay safe you\",

thor and today i'm joined by my colleague sheng wei and today we want to look at building a native android payment integration with firebase cloud functions um if you follow us on our stripe dev twitter account uh you might have seen that we've built some firebase extensions that you can find in the firebase marketplace and for example here we have an extension that allows you to run subscription payments with stripe and the extension brings all the cloud functions and the synchronization with cloud firestore and authentication custom setting of rules and such however if you're familiar with building native applications you might know that for certain projects you have to use the in-app payment apis from google or apple and specifically that's when you're selling subscriptions um in the application or in-game currencies game levels access to premium content uh so if you're upselling content within the app then you have to use the inner payment apis however if you're selling a physical goods or services outside of the apis sorry services outside of the app then you can use stripe to process payments in your native applications and so today today what we want to look at is the um android uh basic integration with our android sdks pre-built ui this ui allows you to collect card details securely in a pci compliant manner as well as billing address details and then automatically stores these details on a customer object and when the customer is authenticated we can then show a list of stored payment methods to that customer and so in order to get started with with this we have a sample here on the stripe samples organization we're going to link that in the description below and so let's just go ahead and clone this down to our local machine great and let's hop in there so i'll open this with vs code here on my local machine here got the readme set up and so the first thing that we need to do is create a new firebase project in the firebase developer console so let's go ahead and do that let's call this firebase android payments sounds good let's not enable google analytics for now and spin up the new project in the meantime we can have a look at the next steps um so specifically when we communicate with the stripe api from our cloud functions we do need to switch to the blaze plan which is the pay as you go you still get a good amount of um free stuff there uh but uh yeah you need to switch to the pay as you go plan so now the project is ready we can step in here so let's simply upgrade to pay as you go let's go ahead great and as a next step so we want to use authentication we do need the authentication to make sure that the user is actually logged in and authenticated when they want to access their storage payment details and so uh in the authentication settings we need to um enable a sign-in method for us here we can just use email and password for now and you can also enable other off method like google or facebook twitter and such so now we got all of that enabled and then uh we will need the firebase cli to actually deploy our project so i've already logged into my firebase account so what we can do now is simply in my functions folder here i have my project details and so um let's go ahead and run always use add and we want to associate this project great and so what you can see now is that we've got a firebase dot firebase rc file uh with our project details that will be used for deployment and in the next step we'll need to install the dependencies for our functions so again here you can see uh the dependencies we get some logging firebase admin firebase functions and the stripe a node library to make uh api requests to stripe uh we're running uh note 10 here in our project and if we step into the function uh real quick you can see here that we're setting up the stripe node client in our project with the stripe secret key and so we need to set that to be accessible in our functions as a secret so the way we do that is using the firebase cli as well so we can set the secret and for this you'll need your stripe account so we've created a stripe account here a fresh one uh just a test account and in the developer settings the api keys now um make sure you don't show your secret keys to anyone that's very important so here this is in test mode so we're not going to blur it out but do not share your life key please great and now that we have um the secret set up the last step we can go ahead and we can deploy our project and here we are only uh deploying the functions uh because we don't have a hosting uh or web project and so so here you can see uh the different functions that we have we're going to step through them in detail later on so we have a function to create a stripe customer to create an informal key we're gonna dive into what that actually means and then we have a create stripe payment we want to handle webhook events when payments succeed or fail for example and then lastly we have a cleanup user a function that when our user wants to be deleted from our application we also take care of the cleaning app in the stripe account great and now our deploy is complete so we can now jump into our firebase project and we can look at all the functions that have been deployed and that is the ones that we just stepped through that's great so now we got the functions ready um and so in the next step what we'll need to do is set up our android project and here i'm going to hand over to xingwei thanks so um so here what we are going to build is something like this we are going to make use of the file-based authentication ui to to create the assigned flows for your applications for example this will be the final results this is making use of the file-based authentication ui and we we are going to use the stripe basic integrations payment activities allow you to add new payment methods into the customer to in um to start the payment sessions as well as complete payments so these are a very simple ui flows we are going to build so let's get started with it the first things we are going to do is to start a new android projects it will be a simple empty activities we can name it as file based demo and we just leave that select the android apis versions as it is and finish it okay this empty object will create and main activities uh this is the ui with simple hardwoods and the main activities if you run it it will be as simple as displaying a text and we want to turn this into a functioning applications allow you to log in as well as making payments making use of the file-based authentication ui as well stripes android-based integrations so what we are going to do now is let's think let's just add because we're going to connect to file base let's go at the internet permissions so now we have we have a simple uh android applications with empty activities displaying hollywood and we are going to add these applications into our projects so what we are doing is now is add an engine we need to input the file based package name matching the file base applications that we have just created and give it a name or paste right demo and register the particular app file base will automatically generate json files which we need to add to the group which we need to add to sorry our android applications so after we download the google service confusion files let's add it to the applications folder this configuration file should resize on the same level as the build.gradle files so let's just edit okay uh this google service basically contains all the configurations necessary to connect to the file based project okay then as the step three we are going to add all the uh file based ui related packages first let's add to the project level uh build.gradle which will be here once we add it we can just let it sync first and in all the projects we need to have the google as the maven added as the repositories and let's just copy this guy to the apps build.gradles okay cool okay that's all uh that's all to add to the google um of the file based authentications services into these applications let's sync this again cool so what we are just now what we are going to build is a few buttons uh into our main applications let's just copy paste those into our layout files here this is a very simple uis where the sign buttons will be visible at the beginning all the rest will be hidden until user is authenticated and obviously we are going when we use a click signs will launch the file based on authentication ui so let's add the file-based authentication ui to the android projects so go to the build gradles we're going to add the file based ui files first sync it now let's go to the main activities file and hook up the button clicking events so when the login button is clicked what we are going to do is to bring up the the authentication ui which uh make use of the email authentication uh first okay so let's just give it um [Music] sign tag id and in the activity callbacks will be able to to get the authenticated user object so let's just add applications local rivals called cut current users okay cool let's just just uh coming out of this one first the show ui is basically um ui updaters uh utility functions allow us to show and hide the applications okay let's just copy paste this part cool yep let's just call your actual ui again okay let's try around these applications and see what it works so it's going to build a ui cool as you can see we are actually showing a sign of buttons when we click it to launch authentication ui provided by file based authentication framework let's just click sign now this is the preview ui of file based authentication libraries let's just test it as e this is a new emails and the firebase authentication will automatically detect this is a new email and ask user to create a new account for example let's just give a very simple password cool as you can see we we are successfully logging to google authentications and we are able to display the usernames now we are ready to uh to actually make use of the stripe basic integrations libraries to to add credit cards and the start payment sessions what we are going to do next is to to integrate with stripes basic integrations preview uis to use the preview uis actually we need to create a customer sessions which allow you to show a list of safe cut payment methods and allow you to add new copy informations into the customers as well as we provide the preview uis for connecting shipping information as well as billing addresses so in order to use uh these preview ui you need to use the e-form keys to establish a customer session this informal key is a short-lived secret which helps to create the customer sessions in the strike mobile sdk with the established customer sessions you could basically operating all these functions including adding deleting and remove updating the payment methods and connecting shipping and building informations thanks ringway yes so now we have our android project scaffolding setup we have firebase authentication hooked in with the authentication ui which allows us to um quickly sign up new users and um authenticate them later on in the application and as showing wayman mentioned with the thermal key in order to create that we need to provide a stripe customer id and we need to make sure that said customer is authenticated so that's how firebase authentication the stripey thermal key play together here so if we go back into our project we can now see that um the user that shengwei signed up is now available in our firebase authentication here and what we now need to do is we need to link this user this firebase user up with a stripe customer object and the way we do this is in the cloud functions so we can the way cloud functions work is there are a list of different triggers that we can use that we can hook into uh to execute our functions and for example here we can um hook into the oncreate for the firebase authentication user so when uh changue created that new user in firebase authentication we can then automatically execute this function uh with the context of this user and so what we want to do here is anytime a user signs up in our app we then want to create a customer object for them so using the stripe node client library we can create a customer object we can provide the email address it is not required so um we could also comment this out here and then one neat thing that we recommend you do is to provide the firebase a user id in the metadata of the stripe customer object and what this allows you to do is to search so the metadata is indexed in the stripe dashboard and it allows you to search for your customers using their firebase user id and then lastly what we do is we actually write to our firestore into the stripe customers collection we create a document for this particular user and then we set the customer id for them so you can think of this as a mapping table between the firebase user id and the customer id so now if we go back into our project we'd expect that to be in the database now because we have a new project we actually don't have a database yet and so we can actually see in the function uh locks here for create stripe customer we can look at the lock so when uh changue created that first user um our firebase function was uh triggered and you can see however here uh it says that where we don't have an active cloud data store or cloud firestore database so we need to create that so in our project just say create we're going to start in test mode which means we can um basically the firebase rules are disabled the security rules only do use that in in test mode in live mode you actually want to deploy some rules and now we're just going to use the default setting here us central now why that is provisioning we can actually look at some firestore rules that we should use for this project so in our database here we have documents we have a stripe customers collection and then for every user that signs up we will have a document in the stripe customers collection and so here is where the security rule comes in uh where we can say that only an authenticated user so where the request um the authentication object in the request matches the user id of the document only those are allowed to read and write to that and then nested underneath we have a sub collection called payments um and there we're going to have all the stripe payments that we create for this user and again we have the rule here that this sub collection can only be read by the particular user when they are authenticated so that way we can make sure that no one can access no user can access the other users data great so now we have our cloud firestore database set up and so now if um changue goes and signs up a new user so we can now see that we have a new user signed up here this is their firebase user id uh if we copy that and we go to our database we now have the stripe customers collection with a document for their specific user id and here we have a stripe customer object and if we go to the stripe dashboard as mentioned we can actually just put in the firebase user id in the search and we'll find the customer object for our user great so that is working all as expected so now that we have firebase authentication uh hooked up with our cloud function and our cloud firestore uh we can create a function to um create the thermal keys or the short lift key that the android payments ui needs to to show the relevant payment methods or add new payment methods so if we jump back into our functions what we do here is we create um what firebase calls a callable function so um from our project we can call this function and the great thing about this is that firebase automatically attaches the authentication context uh and data so here the creative thermal cloud function is a callable function and when it is being called we can check the context to have the authentication object included if it is not authenticated then we throw an error otherwise we pull out the user id from the authentication context and now as long as we have the user id we can now go into our firestore in the stripe customers collection we get the document for this specific user uh we get the data for it and there we have the custom id and so now we have the stripe customer id and we can pipe that into the uh stripe thermal keys create function we set our customer id and the android client also provides an api version this is important for different versions of the sdk to work correctly with the stripe api version and then at the end we have that key created and we return the key so in the context of the basic integration this is the step here where we set up the thermal key so the short lift key and specifically we've done the server-side part here with the uh callable function in firebase and so now shenghway is going to take us through uh the client-side side of things to create the sessions in our android client thank you thought so now the the iframework key has functions has been made in this in the server side on the client side we are going to call the firebase callable functions to get the firmware keys created for this particular customer the way to do it is we need to provide a informal key provider this could be find in in our guides at here in the client site because we are using clothing let's just do this let's create a new calling class called filebase the firmware key be provided and this information provider needs to implement informal key here yep before we're doing that the framework provider is part of the stripe uh libraries which are strap android libraries which obviously we need to include it in our gradle files so in this case let's just using our strong android version of 14.5 okay cool so we need to import the family key providers from stripe packages and yep then we need to overwrite the create informal keys provider functions and this uh great informal key functions uh uh needs to input api versions and callback functions we call the informal key update listeners which will be used by customer sessions cost to establish your customer sessions okay in this we are going to using the file-based functions functions libraries which we have already added these particular packages into into our dependencies and what we're going to do is to call firebase functions with multiplication and we are going to send the data of these particular api versions okay so this file base functions uh is calling the firebase callables of create from a keys which just has just been created by thor in our file based projects and when the when the functions returns we are going to retrieve the results as a string which we will send to the key update listeners so that in the main activities we are going to establish checkout sessions oh it's established uh customer sessions after we create the ufo wiki provider we're going to use uh inject this from a key provider to initialize the customer sessions uh the customer sessions in will be used to create a payment session and we can configure the payment sessions to connect shipping addresses or shipping methods or billing addresses and then we can even show google pay if the android applications support the google pay after the payment session has been initialized we could click start the the payment method selection uis allow you to add new payment method to the customers as well as selecting the existing method to complete the payments okay so this is what the final result will be look like first we create a new customer and this is a new user which does not exist in the firebase authentication database yet so we're going to create a new user for example of like user a and password give it one to six this will create a firebase user which in turn will create a customer in stripe account this then the strap android sdk will make use the ufo key provider to establish a customer session the customer sessions in turn was used to create a payment sessions which allow you to launch a series of android uis so for example one thing you can launch is to a list of existing payment methods belongs to this particular customer since this is a brand new customer obviously there's no payment method no credit cards saved yet what we can do is to save a new credit card to this customer okay let's just make use of 42.42 as you can see this credit card has been saved to this customer through the customer sessions and we can select obviously you can add new cards if you choose to and we can simply select this particular payment method and use it for payments so now we have successfully select a new payment methods for this particular user the next step is to complete a payment using this selected payment method so in order to use the selected payment method to complete a payment method of the payment sessions what we need to do is to create a payment intent uh in the server side in this case using file base so as sheng wei has mentioned we do uh need to create this payment intent on the server side to then uh create a payment with the payment method that was selected by the user on the client now the way we do this is by creating a document in the payments collection in our firestore and in our cloud functions we can listen to new documents being created and we can then create a payment intent for that document so in our android client what we need to do is we need to create a document in the payments collection of the user of the customer and um when that document is created we then execute a cloud function and maybe shane where can you talk us through how we can add a document to the firestore sure first in order to using the file stores we need to obviously add the file stop android packages let's just do this so we are going to use the file style uh library um and in the main activities we are going to create a new document and listening to the creation of these particular documents what we are going to do is this here what we are doing is so this is what we're going to do uh in the front end to create a subtractions of the stripe customers um here we are finding the current user's document and add sub called payments into the current logged in user and we are going to add a new doc new documents on inside the payment connections and add a listener to these particular documents creations because this payment payment documents actually contains a payment it creates a payment intent this is how we um get the payment intent kind secrets from these particular documents so in these success listeners we'll be able to get the document reference and from the document reference we are going we will be able to listen to the stamp shop events uh if the snapshot exists we could get the document information from snapshot data this data will contain the the client secret created of this payment intent so once we get the client secret what all we need to do is to confirm the payments call strike confirm payments apis with the confirm payment confirmed in 10 parameters of this particular payment method ids as well as the client secret we get from this payment documents once we create these uh functions what we need to do is to hook up uh with with the buttons um since we have a button called uh pay button what we are going to do is to listening to the click events and call confirm payments with the selected payment methods so this will be the end results let's rerun the applications okay um apc.com okay let's create a new customer establisher payment sessions as we said we are going to add new payment method into this new customer um and once we select this this new payment methods we are going to create the new documents in the payment um connections sub-connections and these documents will contain the payment intent and client secret which we could confirm it with the selected payment methods so let's do that cool the payment is down what we can do is go to our dashboard as you can see we create a customer xyz abc.com and we are able to confirm um complete these payment methods with this particular payment method we have just added in our using our android sdk preview ui great so now we have our payment made so let's look at what happened on the server side here so xinghui created this user xyz abc.com let's copy the user id here and when we jump into our firestore we can see this user now has a payment sub collection and we can see there is a whole payment intent object in this firestore now as you saw on the client side the only information that sheng wei actually added was the amount and the currency and then our uh so here the amount and the currency and our uh cloud function has then created the payment intent um so let's have a look at how this worked so here we can listen to uh the oncreate trigger for the firestore document here we have a document path so that is for our stripe customers a specific user id the payment sub collection and then the the document id that was added and when a new document is added what we can do is from the snapshot we can get the data and um sheng wei uh specified the amount and the currency uh now in most use cases you probably will specify um a product um id or a price id uh rather than the amount on the client side and then validate that price id from your database in the back end for this demo we just wrote the amount and the currency on the client side and then what we do is we retrieve our customer id using the uh document and we can here uh navigate back from the snapshot to the parent document uh so step back in our path in our database path to get back to our customer id and then using the customer id we create a payment intent for the amount the currency and bound to this customer and then lastly what we do is we take our existing snapshot so the document that was created and we now overwrite it with the whole payment document that was created in stripe so now that is the payment document that then on the android client you um were listening to the update so the update of the cloud function uh writing in the whole payment object including the client secret here so the client secret is then what uh chanway read out on the android client to use to confirm the payment and uh finalize it there now after that here our status of the payment still says requires payment method so because we confirmed the payment on the client side our server side document here is now out of sync and so this is where the web book handler comes in so when the payment was successful stripe can tell us that the payment was successful and we have a function here to then update our payment record um when we get a web or candler so here we can see the um webhook events so we're handling all the payment intent events succeeded processing payment failed and cancelled to then update the payment status so this is a simple http function that can be triggered from stripe so we need to set this up as a webhook url in our project and once we've done that what we do is here we construct the event we verify the signature to make sure that this event actually came from stripe so this is where we use the webhook secret and then we check that we have an event that we want to handle and in that case we then update the payment record so let's have a look how we can set this up so we already have um this this webhook handler function deployed to our firebase project so if we go back to the functions here we can see this handle workbook events and this is the public url for the function so now we can go into our stripe project in the developer settings we have the webhook settings and we can add an endpoint to now point to our handle webhook function so we want a bunch of payment intent events here uh we want the succeeded event we want the processing event uh the processing is in the case of an asynchronous payment method that takes some time until it is succeeded so it will be in a processing state in the meantime uh until then it goes to either succeeded or failed and lastly we want uh the cancelled event as well so at that end point at the point where we at the endpoint um stripe generates a signing secret that we can then use to verify the webhook event and this is what we need to set up on our firebase project as well so let's set the webhook secret here and we want the webhook secret so now when you set a new secret on the project you need to redeploy the functions uh for the changes to take effect so let's do that i believe we can actually specify uh only a specific function to be redeployed so by providing the name here because only our handle webhook events function actually uses the webhook secret so that's the only function that we need to redeploy okay now our handle webpack events function is updated and deployed so now um changue is still locked in with our xyz.abc user so if we look at the database we can actually follow along when xingwei puts through a new payment so let's monitor the payments collection here so xiangwei if you create a new payment for the same customer internet so we can now see the payment has been updated from our cloud function uh it requires payment method and now what the web book handler has triggered and has updated it to succeed so now our synchronization is set up and we can check the webhooks events and we can see here we've handled the payment intent succeeded event which is what updated our firestore document to succeeded great so that's how you can set up native mobile payments with android and firebase cloud functions uh we'll be around for questions in the chat and also if you have uh feedback please uh in the description below there is a form that you can fill in and let us know what you'd like to learn next we are also going to do another episode with the same functions project but showing how to do uh the exact same thing with ios with the thermal keys and all of that so stay tuned for that xiang wei thanks so much for joining us today and running us through the android side of things thank you thank you nice meeting you guys see you next time bye bye bye you\", metadata={'source': 'nw7rOijQKo8', 'title': 'Firebase mobile payments: Android',

Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"the stripe api is organized around standard restful conventions it uses those standard http requests and responses with predictable resource oriented urls request bodies are form encoded and responses are json encoded http requests you make can send data to stripe servers in one of three parts of the request in the request body this is where you pass parameters to create update and take specific actions on objects so for instance if you're creating a customer the customer's email address might be something that you pass in the body of a post request http headers which is where the configuration like api key and api version are sent you know in our docs will often refer to the arguments as request params there's also query string params most often used for filtering lists with get requests in this video you'll learn how to format request parameters so that you can effectively work from the api reference to make most requests and build almost any supported stripe integration the api reference is the detailed documentation about each resource cataloging the supported parameters some sample requests and responses generally when building an integration you'll follow an official guide but may need some specialized params to solve for your specific use case on the left you'll find a list of resources expanding customers shows which api endpoints are available for working with customers under the customer resource we see the customer object and methods for creating retrieving updating deleting and listing customers the customer object describes the shape and attributes of an instance of a customer that's returned in the responses from the stripe api you'll notice that some attributes are marked with the expand label we'll cover the expand feature of the api and how to work with it from client libraries in more detail in another episode however i just want to show that this is how from the api reference you can tell which attributes are expandable the create a customer api endpoint describes the parameters sent to the stripe api when creating a customer on the far right side we see a code snippet example with some basic params note that you can switch from curl to the stripe cli or any of our officially supported client libraries to see a basic code snippet in the programming language you're most familiar with in the next section of the api reference we'll see details about making a request to create a customer these are the parameters that can be sent in the post body to the stripe api to create customer objects the most common parameters are listed at the top and then additional or more advanced parameters are included below under the more parameters subheading if your account's default api version is older than the latest version then you might also see a panel with information about breaking changes released in a newer api version note that all parameters for creating a customer here are optional if we look at the create a payment intent reference you'll see a label showing that the amount and currency parameters are required in some cases parameters might be conditionally required as is true for off session the values for these parameters or the arguments can be scalar values associative arrays arrays of associative arrays or arrays of strings so the sub associative arrays or child parameters can also be deeply nested as is the case with shipping address some params might be enums like tax exempt which accepts the values none exempt or reverse in this episode we'll cover how to construct the arguments passed to the client library so that you're confident in passing scalar values or more complex nested associative arrays right so i've created a file called demo requests.php with stripe php installed via composer and imported and i've got my api key set so let's start with a very simple request to create a customer so i'm going to say create a customer with no params and it looks something like this we're going to say customer is equal to stripe customers create and then we're just going to echo out that customer and then i'll run the code here on the left hand side and in the terminal you can see the results that were returned from stripe so in the terminal output you can see the customer object returned in the attributes that are populated for you by default now if we wanted to fetch this single customer later on we would do so by making a get request with this id um so let's do that next so we can update this and we'll make another method here called uh retrieve customer and that works something like so customer is equal to stripe customers retrieve and this just takes in the string value for the id of the customer so if we run this code again we're going to see the same json returned as we saw when we created the customer but this time we're just fetching the customer that we just created now the id of the customer in this case is going to be set in the path for the request so this is going to be something like v1 customers slash cuss underscore and then the id of the customer there's uh when we're making a retrieve call like this we're not passing anything in the request body and in this specific case we're not passing anything in the request parameters either all right so let's spice things up a bit and create another customer this time with some scalar values create a customer with scalar values stripe customers create and then we're going to pass in as its first argument an associative array with the keys email and the value jenny rosen's email and the key name and the value jenny rosen for the name of the customer and again we're just going to print this out and we'll let's actually also print out the the name and email of the customer all right so we're going to run this you'll see at the very bottom we get jenny rosen and we get the jennyrosen.example.com so this is being printed out and we are able to um pass in some scalar values to create a customer and we can access those in the customer object that is returned again the stripe api expects parameters to be passed as form and coded data in the post body not as json so the response that comes back from the stripe api is json but the request is form encoded so this is what the post body would look like in this case we would have you know a email equal to jenny.rosen at example.com and then in ampersand separating the email key value pair from the name key value pair we'd have jenny and then maybe percent 20 rosen so this is what the the url or the form encoded post body the string would look like when you're working with the stripe php client library it's going to abstract this away so you don't have to think about it but it's something to keep in mind if you're going to attempt to make some requests outside of the context of straight php so yeah keep that in mind if you're going to manually start to implement requests okay next i want to talk about enums so some scalar some scalars accept specific enum values so the tax exempt parameter on customer accepts one of none exempt or reversed so let's say we're going to create a customer with an enum and here we're going to say customer is equal to again stripe customers create with this associative array and this time we're going to pass tax exempt and we'll pass one of the valid values reverse and then we're going to say echo dollar customer and then we can execute this so that created a brand new customer with its tax exempt value set to reverse we could set this to none and then run the code again and we would see that the tax exempt is set to none these are both valid evening values if we were to pass an invalid value for the enum then you'll see that we get a 400 http status code in the response and the error message is going to tell us that we've passed an invalid value for tax exempt it must be one of none reverse or exempt so it's going to tell us when when we're using a value for the enum that is invalid let's also just show like what it would look like to create a customer uh with an invalid parameter so if we just grab these if i tried to pass in um email underscore address recall that the the actual parameter is actually just email but if we pass an email underscore address and attempt to create a customer this way then when we execute this code we're again going to get a 400 error but this time the error message says received unknown parameter and then the name of the parameter email address so it's telling us that this parameter is invalid most common reason for this is just not typing the name of the parameter correctly so you want to check the spelling for your parameter name but it's also possible that your api version the name of the parameter changed in your api version so a couple things to check out there all right so let's up the stakes yet again and send some nested data inside of one of these child parameters with nested associative array um so here we're going to say something like the customer is equal to a a new customer and this time we're going to pass a scalar value at the top level so this is going to be pm card visa and i'll talk about that in a second and then we're also going to pass invoice settings which itself is not a scalar but it is a another associative array so this is a nested or child parameter so default payment method here is a pm card visa okay if we echo that customer invoice settings you can see what i'm talking about all right so that now we've got we've got back uh this sub object or this nested object called invoice settings and it has custom fields default payment method and then a footer so pm card visa is one of the test payment method ids if we pass this at the top level in payment method and also inside of invoice settings p default payment method then our resulting test customer can successfully make recurring payments uh in test mode again for billing subscription or for other invoices so this is how we can create a test customer without without needing to do any tokenization and also demonstrating you know just how to pass some nested some nested data here next i wanted to show you how we can pass in a list of strings so in the case of a customer it supports a parameter called preferred locales so we're going to say create customer with list of strings and here we'll say the customer is equal to stripe customers create the parameter is called preferred locales and it takes a list of strings so maybe this customer speaks both english and spanish i wish that i could speak spanish so we're going to print back out that customer let's also print their preferred locales okay let's see oh all right so this didn't this did not get converted to a string so let's uh preferred locales let's grab the first one and the second one all right so we see en and es they're they're combined here at the bottom and we also see that the preferred locales for this customer have been set to english and spanish so that's how we can pass a list of strings to the stripe api so now that we've created several customers let's see how we can update an existing customer so the concepts from earlier are going to apply however we'll also need to pass the id of the object we want to update so all objects in the stripe api have this string id a customer is going to start with cus underscore and when updating the customer we're going to pass that as the first argument to the update method so here we might say customer is equal to you know stripe customers update so this is going to be the first argument and then the second argument is an associative array with all of our parameters to update the customer so let's update the customer's email address for this customer and we'll just set it to jr example.com all right so let's print out this customer's id and their email address okay so if we run this we see that we printed out the id of the customer and then their email address had a just a space in here and the next thing that we want to do is show that if i change this to jr2 we are going to update that customer the id did not change but now their email address is set to jr2 so that's how you can update a customer with just some simple params we can also follow this same pattern for updating a customer and passing these nested associative arrays so let's now update a customer with nested params so we can say the same same sort of thing so customer is equal to stripe customers update and we want to pass in again the id of the customer and this time we want to pass in um invoice settings and we saw an example earlier with invoice settings where we set the default payment method there's another uh parameter we can pass as part of invoice settings called custom fields and in this case it is an array of associative arrays so here we have two sets of square brackets we have the outer square brackets that says this is going to be a list of sort of objects and then the inner square bracket is the associative array that represents the key value pairs so custom field objects support a name and a common use case is to pass in a tax id here so we might say the name is vat and the value is three abc let's move this up and so that is going to create a brand new or it's going to update this customer it's going to pass in this nested list of associative arrays so now we can echo out uh customer invoice settings and you'll see what i'm talking about so here the stripe object for invoice settings will show you the json when we print it out including the custom fields here which is again a list of these sub-objects which now have a name and value for that and the id the tax id there while talking about tax ids there is now official support in the api for account tax ids so if you're interested in that go check out merchant tax ids okay we can also make a get request to fetch a page from the list of customers with the all method let's do that here so we're going to say fetch a list of customers and it looks like this customers is equal to stripe customers all and then we're going to echo customers we can also just say like maybe we say for each customer's data so data is actually going to be the array or the list of customer objects as cuss and we can just echo maybe we echo out the id of the customer and um let's put a new line okay we're running and you'll see at the bottom here that we have the list of all the ids of all the different customers by default this endpoint is going to return 10 objects max for the page stripe.php also supports autopagination which is a handy tool for working with lists so we have another episode about pagination and we show how to use these list endpoints in more detail showing the limit ending before and starting after parameters all these are covered in the pagination episode so go check that out the customer list endpoint turns out that it can also be used to filter a list of customers by email address so i'm just going to grab this comment this out and say we're going to fetch a list of customers filtered by email and here i can pass in an associative array with email as one of the top level arguments jenny.rosenat example.com and this will make a get request to fetch customers and only those customers with that email address so to show this while we're printing out the id of the customer we'll also print out actually yeah let's say we have the customer id and then that's going to be with a space and then we'll print the customers email okay so if we run this we should see yeah you'll see all the customer ids and the email addresses so a customer object in stripe is not uniquely identifiable by their email address every you can reuse the same email address across multiple customers in your stripe account so here we see ids for several different customers and then the email address that we have filtered by so now we're just pulling a list of customers filtered by email and in this case the email the email value here the key and value are passed in the query string parameters for the get request to the list endpoint for customers so occasionally you may want to delete an object delete expects the id of the object to be deleted so let's delete one of these customers we've created so we're going to say stripe customers delete and we're going to pass in the id of the customer and we'll just print that out so this is how you delete a customer if we run this you'll see that the object was deleted if we pull up the documentation for the payment intent resource you'll see that there are some additional api methods on the left in addition to the standard crud operations some resources support additional actions also known as custom methods in the case of a payment intent you'll see the confirm capture and cancel methods these work similar to update api calls but use a special api path and perform a specific action on an underlying object when we veer away from the standard create retrieve update delete and list operations the custom method names follow a verb naming convention so for instance we have dispute.close paymentintent.confirm charge.capture etc the client library will expose access to custom methods in a predictable way using a name that matches the verb seen in the api reference next up i want to talk about custom methods and to demonstrate let's create and then confirm a payment intent so we're first going to create a payment intent with just the amount and id say intent is equal to stripe payment intense create and we want to pass in an amount ten dollars and the currency is usd so this will create a brand new payment intent we want to echo out its id let's also echo out its uh status okay so we'll run this code and we get back a payment intent and its status is requires payment method so this is how we create a payment intent and by default payment intents are not confirmed automatically so then the next step is to confirm the payment intent so we're next we're going to pass that id into the custom confirm method to uh with a test payment method to confirm this so now we can say something like intent is equal to stripe payment intense confirm and now we want to pass in the id of the payment intent that we want to confirm as the first argument and then the second argument are any other any parameters that are related to this action that we're taking so we need to pass in a payment method and we can use that pm card visa that we talked about earlier that test payment method and then down below again we'll just echo out um the id and the status of this payment intent so we're going to run this and you'll see that the status is now succeeded again we have the same payment intent id um so the custom method here is called confirm when we veer from the standard crud operations like create read update delete the method in stripe.php will be a predictable a predictable method name that matches the name of the verb in the api reference for the action that we're taking on that given object so in the case of confirm or capture or close for a dispute those are all going to be just the name of the verb is the method that's in the client library that you can call some api endpoints are nested under higher level resources so for example when working with a list of lines for an invoice those are accessible through a path which includes the id of the invoice like so sometimes accessing these nested resources requires first fetching an instance of the parent resource in this case an invoice and then second making an api call to list its lines let's take a look next let's talk about nested service methods so on an invoice object an invoice has line items and if you wanted to retrieve those line items you could do so through this nested service methods we can say lines is equal to stripe invoices all lines and then the first argument is the the id of the parent resource so in this case it's going to be an invoice id and then the second argument are the list parameters for filtering this line list of lines so this is this is a list endpoint that is nested under a parent resource so we can pass the standard list parameters here so we might say limit limit five and then echo lines so i'm going to grab an invoice id with the stripe cli stripe invoices list limit 1 pipe to jq dot okay so this should give me an invoice id that we can use okay so i'm going to grab that id enter it here and now when we run our code we should see yeah so we should we see the the invoice line items that are related to this invoice so this is how we can make requests to a nested service method now technically under the hood this is making a request to v1 invoices in xxx like the id of the parent resources slash lines and because of this query string parameter here we're passing in limit equals five so that's kind of what this looks like is we have a bit that is the query string param we have the by saying all lines we know that we're doing a list method for the lines which are nested under this parent resource so that is how we access a a nested service method okay thus far our examples have passed data into the client library methods and the client library has form encoded and sent those values to the stripe api either as part of the request body or in the query string params let's turn to passing configuration options in the request headers headers are most commonly used for authentication versioning and stripe connect you'll want to refer to the authentication episode to learn about how api keys are passed or to the versioning episode about how to specify the api version in the headers either globally or per request so the particular use case i want to cover briefly here is for stripe connect connect enables you to build a platform to facilitate payments for other sellers or vendors users connect their stripe account to your stripe account and then you can make api calls on their behalf once connected this works by passing the id of the connected account in the http headers let's take a look at how to pass the connect account id header now so far all of the api calls that we've made have been related to our own account with stripe connect and in the case of passing a per request api key or a per request api version or with with stripe connect the id of the connected account we can take actions on behalf of accounts that have connected to us so in the case where we wanted to create another customer but this time on a connected stripe account we can say customer is equal to stripe customers create and recall that we have been passing in this top level argument maybe it has an email address and this is how we can create a customer on our own account but it turns out that the create and update and most methods when working with objects in the stripe api and with stripe php are going to accept this final optional argument where you can pass in these request params or request options you can think of it as a way to configure the request and so this might be your per request api version or api key but you can also pass stripe account here and uh i want i just wanted to call this out that this is a us a an argument that is a completely separate associative array which includes these request configuration options and in this case we can pass a stripe account value and the string value being the id of an account that has connected to my platform so that i can take actions on their behalf now if we run this code we'll see that it creates a customer object and if we inspected that more closely we would know that this customer object is attached to this connected account it does not connect is not attached to the platform it's connected to this disconnect account so this just wanted to call out that this is how you pass the request params or request options to configure the request and this stripe account here is actually sent in the headers the request headers when making a request this is not in the body so the email will be sent in the body the stripe account will be sent in the header as a quick recap in this episode you learn how to make requests to the stripe api to create retrieve update delete and list resources we looked at the api reference documentation covered custom methods nested services and passing request headers for connect thanks so much for watching we'll see in

cursor-based pagination and auto-pagination with stripes apis before we dive into what this looks like in each of our client libraries i'll go over some of the basics of making list requests all top-level api resources have support for bulk fetches through list methods that split up the results into chunks known as pages these api methods will return results one page at a time in reverse chronological order and the requests all share common structure they can take in three optional parameters limit starting after and ending before the limit parameter is used to specify how many objects you want to fetch per call the starting after and ending before parameters take in an existing object id and are mutually exclusive only one of the two can be used in a single request setting the starting after parameter returns the next page of results that come after the passed in object setting the ending before parameter returns the previous page of results that comes before the specified object as we go through each language you'll see examples of how these parameters are used with cursor-based pagination and how that compares to auto-pagination i've created a file called pagination.php with stripe.php installed and my api key already set using the new client and services pattern this is the new and recommended way to initialize the stripe client and work with stripe.php that said if you're working with an older version of stripe.php you might be using the static method style you can tell which pattern you use based on the way the api key is set this is just a small example of how the api key is set in the older static method style for today's demo we'll be sticking with the newer style client and services model some of the doc snippets have not yet been updated so keep in mind you might need to refer to the api reference let's start by listing a page of customers you based on the output i can see that only 10 customers will return from stripe even though i have more customers on my account that's because each page returned from a list request will have 10 objects by default we can change that by setting the limit parameter which can be any integer between one and one hundred but what if we want more than just the two most recently created customers in order to get the next page of results we can use the ids of the customers returned from the api response for instance we can see that the last customer has this id we can use this as input to tell the api to give us the next two results that come after this customer by setting starting after you can see that this response gives back different customers than the first response it also has a has more property as we page through customers hazmar will tell us whether there are additional pages of customers we can retrieve if you wanted to page the customers in the opposite direction you could set ending before to the id of the first customer in the return list this is known as cursor-based pagination when you put all these concepts together you can write code to create and print a list of all our customer ids you first we do an initial call to retrieve and store the ids of the first 10 customers then we make subsequent calls to retrieve the next sets of customers until has more is no longer true finally we print out our results now you may be thinking that this is a lot of code to just print out all of your customer ids this is where auto pagination comes in our client libraries offer auto pagination helpers to easily traverse all pages of a list we can set our limit to the maximum page size of 100 and then use auto pagination to cycle through every customer and grab their id this code does the exact same thing as a regular pagination example it has all the ids to a list prints the list and prints the total number of customers as you can see in the examples using auto pagination allows you to easily handle bulk fetches with code that's clean and easy to understand thanks for watching if you have any questions or run into any issues let us know\", metadata={'source': 'IGh-pn2g5_0', 'title': 'Pagination with stripe-php', 'description': 'Unknown',

Document(page_content=\"[Music] welcome back to stripe developer office hours my name is charles and i'm a customer solutions engineer here at stripe in this week's episode of developer office hours we're going to be talking about sharing cards across from platform accounts to connected accounts for those platforms that use direct charges but need to share the customer payment methods from the platform to the connected account so why would you want to do this so imagine that you're building a platform that's a store builder you may want to enable the end customer to be able to save their card details for one merchant and then be able to use those card details for all of the other merchants that exist under your platform without having to re-enter their their payment details every single time so what card sharing allows you to do is it allows you to save the customer and the customer's payment methods on the platform account and then share it to the connected account and in this video we're going to talk about how you can use card sharing to create one-time tokens so that you can save all of the customer objects and payment methods on the platform and then whenever a user needs to use one of those payment methods for any merchant they can simply uh select the select the payment method and then just as they're about to make a payment you make a clone you consume it and then the customer is able to complete their payment without having to re-enter their payment uh information and on your end you won't have to keep state on all the different payment methods for all the different uh connected accounts for all of the different customers in your database or anything like that you'll just create these one-time ephemeral tokens and have a very lightweight easy to use approach to sharing customers across multiple connected accounts so let's before we actually run this demo let's just see what it looks like to have a to have this set up so in my stripe dashboard i actually have two things uh pulled up in two tabs i have one so what we have here is the uh strike dashboard for a platform and we're looking at a specific customer now this is a customer that has four payment methods attached to the customer object and in this setup you would store the cards on the platform but because you're doing direct charges you won't actually have any payments on the platform so in this setup you would expect to see a customer who has payment methods but then no payments and then for every connected account you would have another customer and that customer would have payments but no payment methods because you would be using one-time tokens so let's take a look at what the connected account would look like so here is a connected account that is attached to the platform that i just showed you and here's another version of that genie rosen uh customer now this is a instance of that customer on the connected account now keep in mind this customer isn't actually linked to uh the customer on the platform it just has the same information they don't keep stay with each other at all and in fact they have different customer ids but they do represent the same customer who exists in real life and as i said before when you use car sharing you're going to have payments but no payment methods now i just created this customer so there are no payments but let's see what it looks like to use a one-time token to share a card with a customer on the connected account and accept the payment now let's put it into practice we're going to generate a one-time token from the platform customers payment method their mastercard and then we're going to share it with the connected account and then we're going to make a payment and the payment is going to be attached to the customer that exists on the connected account all right great so we can see that we created the card from the platform account then we created a clone of the car and shared it with the connected account we got a new card for our connected account and we were able to use that new car to confirm our payment intent uh using the client secret on the client side and we were able to successfully make the payment now if we go into our dashboard again we will be able to see that the jenny rosen customer on the connected account has a payment but no payment methods let's just refresh here perfect so now that we know what we're doing let's get started actually building out this demo let's get started so we're going to begin by bootstrapping our app using their stripe cli if you have a stripe cli installed and you're logged in you can use the command stripe samples create to create a boilerplate app so that's what we're going to start with today we'll just type in developer office hours this is going to give us like a folder with a server and a client index date index.html file basic server file so let's do that and you can pick a server in any one of the languages that stripe supports now let's install our dependencies actually i also have some templates that i like to use so let's let's just do that okay now let's install our dependencies okay we have our dependencies installed we have our boilerplate app we uh we should be all set up here so let's just open up our code editor all right so like i said before this is what we get when we open up a uh when we open up the border plate code you get a client folder with one html file we get a server folder with a server.pi file and of course we have our requirements that we needed to install okay so this file is really really basic it uh pulls in your stripe secret key from a dot in file that has created and it has your stripe secret key if you're already logged in it also has a basic route that's just going to uh return this index.html page that has like a nice form uh where you can set up a button and things like that and then we have a webhook handler we're not actually going to be using webhooks for this example so we'll just delete that and i'm just going to set this to debug equals true so that our server refreshes every time we make a change okay let's just make sure that this works all right perfect so this looks like our example before but uh it just doesn't have any functionality it doesn't have any payment any payment methods from the platform listed so let's fix that so we're going to we're going to start by going to our server.pi file and what we're going to do is just make um an api call to the server.pi file uh we're making it what we're going to do is uh make it an api call to stripe uh specifically we're going to want to list the uh payment methods for the customer on the platform account but in order to do that we're going to actually need to get the uh customer id from that platform account so let's just hop over into the stripe dashboard so that we can get that information okay so we're in the strike dashboard and you could do this programmatically but for this example we only have one customer so we're just going to grab this customer here and as you can see this customer has four different payment methods and a customer id let's copy the customer id and hop back into our file uh let's just put this inside of the m file here let's say we'll call this the stripe platform customer id okay we're also going to need the strike connected id uh connected account id now that's that's the connected account that we're going to be making direct charges for so let's hop back over to the dashboard and grab that okay and here's the id we're just going to copy this over as well so we'll just call this the stripe connected account id and we're also going to be um we're not just going to pull the customer uh we're not going to just pull payment i payment methods from the platform customer we're also going to make those charges against a representation of the same customer but on the connected account and the reason we want to do this is so that if we ever wanted to pull all the transactions for a specific customer we would be able to do it by associating each transaction each charge with the customer on the connected account so let's hop back into the dashboard one last time and we're going to actually look at the dashboard for the connected account and not the platform this is the connected account seeing it from the uh view of the platform we can also see it directly here and here is the same customer that is represented on the platform account now you notice this has a different id because it's a different customer object they have similar information but they're not actually the same thing and what this customer is going to do is this customer is going to have payments but no payment methods because we're going to be passing it one time payment method tokens whereas the jenny rosen customer on the platform will have payment methods but it won't have any uh actual payments so let's just take a look at that here so again so the payment methods in this setup where we're using one-time tokens for one-time payments we're going to have our payment methods stored on a customer object on the platform and then we're going to have our payments actually associated with the customer object that exists on the connected account and by having this setup it will allow us to store the payment methods in a single place while also having all of our transactions linked to a customer uh in the respective connected connected account so now that we have that information let's just go back to server.pi and we are going to call this one the stripe connected customer id and paste that in there okay so now that we have that we can just pull in some of those uh values there so uh what did we call these things i'm just going to copy this i can remember what they were called so we're going to say that the stripe the platform customer is going to be equal to the platform customer and the uh connected customer it's going to be equal to os.getm this connectedcustomer and let's just get rid of this value here and the connected account customer is the connected account is going to be equal to this value here and let's clean this up here okay so we have the values that we need to build out our use case uh so let's just list the payment methods for the customer on the platform account great so now that we have the cards it's going to come in as a list we will want to actually uh render these cards uh on index.html so flash uses ginger templates which means that we can just pass it in as an argument here say cards equal to cards and later on we are going to use stripe.js and in order to use stripe.js we're going to need to pass in two things uh first because we're using um because we're using connect and we're going to be making api calls on behalf of a connect account connected account we are going to want to pass that in so that when we initialize um strike.js so let's just say the connected account equals uh the connected account we're also going to need to pass the publishable key now the publishable key is what allows stripe.js to make api calls uh or just do things in general with stripe on the client side so we're going to pass that in as well so we're going to pass the publishable key that's going to be equal to os.get hems stripe publishable key and we're going to now have to hop into our index.html file to actually make uh use of this list of cards here so our index.html file has the typical uh boilerplate that you will get with stripe samples uh mine also has uh just these two little details here um to differentiate it a bit and remind us of what we're doing uh it also has this script tag which is uh strike.js this is what this is we're going to be using to uh complete the payment on the client side and in general you're going to need this to uh do anything really with stripe on the client's eye using the strike.js library so let's just um render these cards out so what we're going to do is we have a list of cards that's being shared with the template so we're just going to make an unordered list and for every car we're going to add a list item that is a radio button that has some information about the car [Music] great so you can see that here we have our uh jinja for loop here where we're making a list item it's radio button and we're going to pass along the brand the id the last four digits of the card and then the expiration details so let's take a look at this and just save everything here okay cool so let's take a look if we refresh we should see a list of our cards and we do so these are all the cards that exist for that jenny rosen customer on the platform and if you look at these ids and these expiration dates these are all um which you would see on the dashboard for that customer and we can just verify that by popping back into the dashboard so that was the mastercard and this is also the mastercard you can see that we have the uh same id here and we also have the same expiration date so that's working as expected so the next step is going to be to actually get to the meat of this video which is sharing the car now our approach to sharing cards for this use case is going to be to create a one-time reusable token to create a one-time non-reusable token so that you can immediately uh check out one of the advantages to this approach is that we won't have to keep state on which cards exist on the platform we'll just list whatever happens to exist and then we'll create a one-time token just in time for the payment and so you'll never create a token that you won't use and you won't have to build a database or anything like that to uh or build or um set up web hooks or anything like that to essentially uh keep state on what's happening on the platform so that you can sync it with what's happening on the connected account so that's going to be our next step so let's hop back into our server.pi file or actually um yeah let's hop back into the server.pi file so what we're going to do is the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to create a route um for uh sharing a card from the platform to the connected account okay so our app our app.row is going to call it sharecard and it is going to um be uh post only and what we're going to do here is uh we're going to call it sharecard and let's think about what we're going to do here so the first thing we're going to need to do in order to share a card from the platform to the connected account is actually get the card that we want to share so uh on the front end we're just going to make sure that whatever we select we pass it on to um we pass it on to this route so let's say that the payment method and that's just a generalized uh term for cards and all other forms of payment we're going to say the payment method is the request dot json.get payment method and once we have the payment method we can actually just create a new payment method that is a duplicate of the payment method on the platform customer and share it with the connected account customer all in one call so what does this look like so what we're going to do is we're going to call um we're going to call the payment method um the payment method endpoint and we're going to pass it three parameters the first parameter is just going to be the platform customer now this is the customer that actually has the card uh the second parameter is going to be um the payment method and this is the payment method that the platform customer actually owns and then the third parameter is going to be the stripe account now this is going to be account the account that you want to uh share the card with so what's going on here again we're just getting a customer a specific card that's a link to that customer and we're saying hey stripe please create a duplicate of this account of this card and share it with this connected account that's attached to my platform now once we have this shared card what we need to return to the client is just the shared card id we don't need to we don't need to uh return the entire uh object because when you're doing client-side confirmation only thing you really need is the id of the payment method so we're just going to do that just going to return [Music] the um we'll just call this card because it's always going to be a card um we're just going to return the shared card.id and um let's see what we got here okay yeah let's just start with that and let's just add some comments as well just just in case so share the card with the share the platform customers card with the connected account okay and this is fairly self-explanatory but we'll just give it a note as well okay now let's hop back into index.html and uh begin to add some functionality to the uh the form button as well as begin to make use of strike.js so in this in this example we're just going to be doing everything in this javascript tag and the first thing that we're going to want to do is just set up stripe now what does it mean to set up stripe essentially you are going to um pass to stripe the publishable key this is what belongs to the platform and it allows you to make calls for the platform as well as calls on behalf of the connected accounts that are connected to the platform the second argument is going to be the stripe account that you're actually making calls for so by default if you just initialize uh strike.js with just a publishable key you are making calls for your platform account um if you want to make calls for the connected account and you and you do when you're making direct charges because uh that's the pattern you make a call with you make a call for a specific connected account you need to specify that here now while we while we're doing this example we'll want to see what's going on we have this debug message div here so let's just take advantage of it we're going to create a function that's going to uh just let us push messages to that div okay and eventually um that did that div is going to get really busy so we want to have some way to uh clear it out as well okay so let's see we uh we've initialized stripe and let's just put a comment for that one [Music] and we have our [Music] we have our debug function so that we can kind of log things as they happen so what do we want to do next the next thing we want to do is uh get the form so that we can start we can add an event listener and add some functionality to it so what we're going to do is we're just going to get the form and we're going to ask event listener to um submit and what we're going to do first is uh let's see well what are we trying to accomplish we want to share the card so we need to figure out which card is being uh which card is selected when we click submit so let's just do that we're going to get the card it's currently selected okay and once we have the card that's currently selected we have what we need to share the card so let's do that too share the card with the connected account using um our share card endpoint so let's do that and what we're going to do is we're just going to use fetch we're going to fetch from uh that share card endpoint and we're just going to pass it the payment method um of the card that we have so we're just going to pass in whatever card we selected and that card would be a card from uh the platform customer and we're going to get back a response with the card so let's actually add some messages in here so that we can see that these two things are actually going to be different so we're going to um put in a debug message here to say got the card from we'll just say what the card is getting the card from the platform account and let's just throw a message in here to say that we're about to create a clone and share it and let's call out to connect account and uh once we have finally gotten our response from our sure court endpoint let's just um show what that looks like so we're going to say we got a new car for our connected account and it's going to be the card okay so let's take a look at what we got here so we have we're getting the form we have an event listener we are going to just get the select currently selected card and then we're going to log it out to our debug messages div and then we're going to announce that we're creating a card um we're creating another card based on we're creating another card for the connected account based on the card that exists on the platform using our endpoint and then once we get a response from that endpoint we're just going to say we're just going to announce that we have it and see what it looks like and ideally the card here is going to look different from the card there all right so let's take a look at um let's take a look and we're just going to click the mastercard okay so that didn't work [Music] and it looks like we have an error somewhere in our server.pi file and it's a misspelling okay so that needed to be shared card so let's take a look here all right so let's try that one more time okay perfect so we have we um got the card and we got it from the uh platform account then we announced that we were creating clone from for the connected account and then after we called our share card endpoint we actually did manage to get a new payment method now this payment method represents the same card as before but it's associated with the connected account so now that we have this we can just create a endpoint that an endpoint on our server.pi file that allows us to create a payment intent and then we can hop back into our um client and actually and actually just use strike.js to confirm the car payment and we'll be done okay so let's do that so um first let's just create a new route and we're going to create a new route and this route is going to be to create a payment so we're creating a route for making a payment intent [Music] and this is [Music] pretty general here we're just going to call it create payment intent it's also going to uh be post only [Music] and uh we're going to make a minimum viable payment intent here and this payment intent is going to have an amount um it's going to have an amount and since it's going to have a currency it's going to have the stripe account and the stripe account is going to be the connected account because again we are trying to do a direct charge on the connected account it's also going to have an application fee amount just because oftentimes uh platforms do charge um their merchants a fee for facilitating payments great so we have this payment intent but we're not going to return the entire payment intent if you've seen the accepting a payment video on this very same channel you know that when you um use client-side confirmation when you are using when you're completing the payment on the client side you only need to return the client secret and this is great because it keeps you from potentially exposing information that might be sensitive on the payment intent so we're just going to uh return that client secret [Music] the payment incentive client secret so let's just do that just call this client secret and we'll say payment incent dot client secret and we'll just add a note here and because we're not returning this entire payment content we'll just make it known that we're returning the client secret great so now we are we're uh nearing the end so let's hop back to index.html and we're gonna do here is um we're going to add just one more api call now generally you want to make the payment intent call as early as possible like you might even want to do it as you're generating uh this um this html file but for this example we're just going to do it after we're just going to do it after we've gotten the card the new card for the connected account so let's do that we are going to call the create payment intent uh endpoint get the client secret and then after that we are going to confirm the card payment using stripe.confirm card payment right okay so let's start with this first step so we are going to create the payment intent and this is also going to be fetch to our uh back end but it's not going to contain any arguments because we've already defined the amount and the currency and all that good stuff um there now once we got the client secret um let's just um put it in our messages so let's say [Music] and um let's also announce that we're now that we have the client secret uh the next step is just going to be confirming the payment like we've created the payment intent we've shared the card uh we're ready to accept the payment at this point so let's just announce that we're going to confirm the payment here [Music] okay so we're just going to pass the client secret and this is what i'll let strike know that we're confirming the car payment and what car payment we're confirming and we're also going to pass in the payment method this is the payment method that is going to be charged when we actually confirm the card payment so let's just um also add the payment intent to the debug messages div so that we can take a look there's an error we'll be able to see why uh there's an error if not we'll be able to see that we were successful and verified that uh the payment intent was created against the payment method that was shared and not the payment method that exists on the platform so we're just going to json stringify this uh confirmed card payment this confirmed card payment intent [Music] and this should be it but there's only one way to find out so let's go take a look at our um our app let's see here do believe that i have a bug okay okay let's restart our server and we're just going to do a quick refresh here and we're going to select this mastercard and click pay okay perfect let's see what happens so we got the card we got the card from the platform we created a card for this connected account then we got a new card and shortly afterward we created a payment intent and got our client secret and then we confirmed the payment intent and we can see that this payment intent was successful and it was successful using the one-time token that we used for uh that we got when we shared the platform payment method with the connected account uh but this is great but like let's take a look at it in the dashboard so as i said before when you're using one-time tokens to share payment methods uh from a platform account to a connected account you'll see payment methods in the platform but you won't see payments and then in the connected account you'll see payments but you won't see uh payment methods and this has the benefit of not having more payment methods than you need in the connected account it has the benefit of not requiring you to keep state on what's happening in the platform account with the um slight disadvantage that it does put another api call in the path of making a payment but any case if this is working we should see a payment here and perhaps we did it with the wrong customer so let me just take a look here actually we were using uh i think we were using this customer instead so let's just make another payment because i believe that we may have been using the raw customer there but the uh the essential lessons of what i just showed you uh and the overall pattern remains the same even if in this case because i hardcoded the customer object that we uh made the payment for the wrong customer let's take them take a look here let's take a look here okay so actually i think there's a chance that our payment intent is not actually setting the customer so let's hop back into our server.pi file and sure enough we don't have the customer defined so um [Music] you'll want to remember that when you create a payment intent uh and you want to associate it with a particular customer make sure to define the customer and payments in so now if we make a payment this should be linked to the jenny rosen customer in our connected account dashboard so when we refresh we should we should see a payment here now okay perfect so we see the payment the payment intent it was successful we have payments no payment methods in the connected account and on the platform we have payment methods and no payments thank you so much for joining developer office hours um hopefully this was really really useful sharing payment methods with connect platforms that use direct charges is a really really great feature because it allows you to create almost like a wallet like experience for that end customer where they can really just enter in their payment information once and then they can reuse it across all of the different merchants that might be attacked to your platform when you're building a platform that doesn't have recurring payments that's not using stripe billing using a one-time just-in-time approach to building out to actually sharing payment methods is a really great approach it's very lightweight you don't have to add in additional dashboards you don't have to worry about things like using um webhooks to keep state on what cards get added and detached from the platform customer and if you're using card account updater you don't have to worry about a card being charged for an update across multiple connect accounts in addition to a platform account so this is a really great approach to sharing cards for those platforms that can afford the slight uptick in latency that they might experience if in a future video based on the response of this video we may tackle how to go about attaching uh shared payment methods to the connected account so that they can be reused so if you're interested in learning more about uh the different types of approaches to sharing cards from this approach to an approach where you would save the car and attach it to the customer on the connected account or even approach where you wouldn't do it just in time like we have here but you would proactively attach the cards let us know thanks so much for joining developer office hours i'm charles

welcome back this segment is going to be about building out product pages with nexjs backed by graph cms so that we can build this headless ecommerce uh platform i think you're really going to like it so let's dive in so we're going to kind of start from scratch we have an empty basically an empty directory here and we're going to create a brand new next js app so we can say npx create next app and we'll say it's like graph mess stripe check out um and yeah i think maybe the very first thing we need to do is just build a page where we can sort of list out our products um sure if that makes sense okay uh and yeah maybe then we can have like a product show page or something that has a button on it that when you click it it will create a checkout session redirect to checkout allow you to purchase and then maybe we can add some uh some web hook stuff yeah i would definitely just let's i would say we we get the um the check out let's get the data down um then maybe i have striped yes um cool and obviously load stripe as well and then because there's a few different elements to this there's the the actual data fetching and building the the pages in nextus then there's also the uh api roots element right because we have that server side requirement um to create a check checkout session with stripe we have to do that on the on the some kind of server environment um so thankfully nextgs has api routes where we can just quickly add a service function to take care of that so i think let's get the data down bill a few you build some product pages and then um yeah i'd stripe check out sounds great oh all right nice okay so we're up we're up and running here we've got pages index.js that we want to go edit all right so i think we can drop into here and maybe we can just delete everything that came with with this new app cool and then yeah so i think we want to we want to like fetch products right as like the very first thing um so maybe we need to like yarn add um is it graphql request yes we're gonna need yes you're gonna need some kind of library or some kind of client to fetch data now because we're because we're probably going to use nextgs kind of data fetching primitives whether that's get server-side props or get static props we don't really need a fully fledged graphical client for the cache aspects we can use something like like graphql requests that you've added okay it's essentially um it's just kind of a a wrapper around fetch right um which interestingly you can just use fetch um with gokul a lot of people don't know that then you you have to like um it's just simply a post request right with kind of like a post request and the body is kind of um just the query is a string stringify version of the query okay um see yeah a lot of people don't don't know that um but you know you get one thing with using something like graphql request is that you get the kind of semantic sugar that um it brings by using graphql so you can use the kind of graphql tag to get a nice um nice indentation on your on your query and things like that so there are benefits to that so yeah i think the way this works right is we just pass it um so from from graph cms yeah uh here so i'll go ahead and get the okay you've got the you've got the link i think it's settings api access this thing yeah i've dropped that in there oh perfect oh wow okay nice um uh okay cool uh and then yeah so then we want to like if we were to just do the same query that you ran from the explorer it would be something like uh maybe products is away graph cms.request and then we just pass in kind of your whole your same your same query right so we would say like products name slug id price like all of that would just go kind of like there and then we should have access to products um that's yeah it's like that easy right like you just gotta like throw in a couple packages and then write a write a little query and then uh yeah exactly you got some json then then the phone begins with the json right okay um yes what's interesting is you've kind of put the you know you've written the query inside of um the react component [Music] which is fine um that would essentially run client side um so on on page load it would run so obviously nextgs has these nice um data fetching primitives or apis for us and you're writing one there against that props okay so that'll essentially run yeah so that that query would now run at build time and build those pages or build that page uh with that data statically for us yeah cool so yeah so this would run this runs at build time not at or this runs server side not client-side because we're we're just taking advantage of this um helper that next gis gives us is that right yeah that runs that runs a build there is a get service side props as well okay okay that that is a server-side request um which has also has its benefits but in this case of building product pages like this where we're not necessarily expecting data to change massively right the speed advantage of building these pages ahead of time is actually much more beneficial so i would say get started props is probably the right uh the right functional fetch and function to use here okay perfect and then now our like we will have access to products because these um like our component that we're exporting here this react component like products will be passed in as sort of like a static json blob on the client when it renders right and then we can use that yeah so inside of get stack props you know we've made our um our query to graph cms and products has been returned and then inside of that function we're actually returning um you know returning a props object and passing products inside of there and what that means is that then that products object is available to us inside of the the props of the actual function component um so yeah at that point you have you'll have access to the products uh it'll be an array okay so then we can do something like this right where we restructure all the stuff from the product and then return like a i don't know uh something maybe just to start let's see if we can get the names to render right yeah so what what happens is although um it's like props in a production build run the build time um this will actually run each time you load the page and when using your next dev okay when you're in practice are you are you seeing like get static props or get server props more commonly used in my use in my usage definitely get started props um because as i said get server side props does have use cases um you would generally use that where perhaps data is more dynamic and so you have to think get service out props that's going to be run each time the page is requested or somebody hits the page that that they're going to it's that's gonna that query all that uh get service out props function is gonna run and it's gonna return the latest data at that time so essentially each time you're it's running on the server and then serving up that generated html from the cdn whereas we've got static props is you're building the html ahead of time serving that statically on a cdn and each person each time that's hit this is getting served the same html so i think in a lot of the work that i'm doing get started props with combined with get static paths and we'll we'll come to that those are the the the two that i'm using most often okay cool it looks like it worked like we're seeing some names here yeah so we're fetching data and putting it on the screen that is like the the story of web development right um so yeah all right we just call it our day now we're done yeah uh should we make it we should probably make this a link right um i think there's like a next thing or is it next link yeah yeah we give it we give it an href right we're saying we don't have to like name this anything different than a normal a tag and the href would go to somewhere like uh product slash and then maybe the slug so that's kind of why we used we're out of the slope to the um to the scale i guess for for prettier page paths urls using a uid um so yeah we'll link it to the product page now so i guess we need to build those okay yeah so yeah if you you can see when i hover at the bottom this would go to like products slash snapback cap because that's the slug right same thing with the hoodie also it kind of got a little gross but just keep it easy keep it easy here give these things some space all right so then um yeah so if we go to pages now um i guess we have to create like a new directory called products and then yeah this was a little weird to me but you you call it um you use square brackets and you say slug.js is that right yeah so what you're doing here yeah is essentially using kind of the file system to declare dynamic routes um so by creating this slug file with the square brackets you're essentially stating that slug is a dynamic parameter and it's going to be used to build um a sub directory of pages uh inside of products so you would use this kind of dynamic routine file system in pair with get static paths in next year's okay what that does is you actually you'll see i want all of my products from my remote cms and then for each product inside of that build this page essentially right okay so you use get static paths with get static props um so do we we i guess we have to probably export a uh get static get static paths and get static like we have to do like uh get static paths and we have to do get static props right in this file exactly okay so let's do let's do that yeah so with get static paths you're generally just fetching the data to build the path in this case the slug okay so that's going to be very similar to this i'm just going to like yeah copy might be worth kind of exporting that graphical client just to its own you can just import i can see that um yeah i wish uh this editor would not lose the graphql or like the query the query formatting but it is what it is uh yeah um so what you can do to actually counter that is actually use the graphql tag so you can do like gql something like that okay i think it's this from [Music] gotcha okay yeah that's what i mean so then you get the um so if you basically kind of it's kind of syntax highlighting for a graphql nice oh i see i see now it's yeah okay now it's not only formatted nicely it's syntax highlighted too cool yeah it's a lot easier when you start doing more complicated things so if you write if you wrote like a query like this where you might have a variable yeah you can see what i mean like the actual syntax highlight is is much more beneficial there okay yeah let's do that with getstatic props because that's going to be a little bit more complex right like we'll have x4 async um get static props and this one is it's more complex because we have to like get a specific one right i guess this is this takes in params maybe and then uh yeah or they come in sort of like this so gets get started paths returns uh the return statement is a little different there it's actually going to return a a params object sorry a paths it's going to return an array of paths or a paths array and inside that um it expects params so the slug in that case okay yeah and and then this is going to be just going to say like uh grams slug like that exactly okay cool and then i've seen i've seen this fallback uh false what does this part do fall back false yes you you have to provide the fallback key and what that does is it's essentially so it's gonna tell nextgs whether or not to fall back to rendering this or building this page dynamically so for example if i was to write a query up here for example that only returned three products of the five in my catalog and somebody went to the path for one of those products that wasn't built if fallback uh is there fallback is true and that will essentially then go off and rebuild that uh on the fly whoa okay gotcha so say for example you have products one through five i've written a query that's queries for products one through three and we build static pages for those with get started profs props if somebody then went to products slash five using fallback true would actually go off and build that page dynamically so it would run the same request uh the same get static props request and build that page on the fly and then that would be served uh in the cdn to everybody else um down here i think we just say like away graph uh cms dot um request i always want to say fetch uh yeah instead of request it's like uh yeah it's it's yeah i guess yeah i mean they've they've probably it is essentially a semantic wrapping around the request library i guess yeah or fetch libraries so it's probably for a while then here we want we want like a single product but we can't just say product or we can't just say like product where because we want to pass in like params right so we have to define a new query is that right yes you'll need to to write a query like you are and then actually kind of define the graphql variable like so yeah and then that will be available to you and then the dot sign is a graphical variable right and then that that like ties to something down here right where you say like or actually this is we want all of these to be slug right um yes we're going to find by slug yeah that may be string type yeah yeah so the second argument so in the graphql request um function uh the first argument is the query or the mutation and the second argument is is the variables uh so yeah that's exactly right okay cool and then i guess on this page we probably want name uh slug price images is that uh images is gonna be something like like that right to query the sub like the asset is going to have a url property is that correct that's right yeah so when there are subfields like so you you kind of yeah you have to um use the hash or the essentially and specify the subfields um so url will be useful um if we're going to use the next image component probably also want the width and the height of each asset all right i'll get the idea as well just because um sure you know react uh expects oh too sorry the idea of the images oh because yeah it's gonna want um because if we bump over those react expects a unique key so it's i always just ask for the id because i know it's there okay cool so then this this is a git static prop so this one returns props right return yes switch points at product something like that and then this whole thing is going to export default and then this is going to get a product uh yeah like that and then yes the outcome of get static props is is available inside of your react functional props functional component probes okay so let's see if that is doing anything yet and uh graphql is not a function uh it's that's my fault it's okay i think it might be um the import gql from graphql maybe no it's it's yeah it's that but from there oh is it okay yeah oh okay maybe this gql thing can we just like see if if we remove that that helps i know that shouldn't matter but query product page query pass and slug are we is params is this param slug for sure or is that going to be nested somewhere some other way there okay so now we see test okay so then change if we change this to is that name okay it's working i don't know what happened that was weird actually no we changed gql uh i think i think what it might have been was that we were exporting an async function here okay also they prefer to kind of do okay cool so now we've got like something showing up on the page um can we yeah i would love to see some of the new next.js image stuff so um i haven't i haven't worked with this before is it it's just an image tab the image tag that comes from from next yeah so it's a [Music] next image here it's just a component and it's essentially a drop-in replacement for the html element issue an image element um so it accepts very similar props src width height um but will kind of bring a lot of progressive enhancement with it lazy lawn adaptive uh asset loading depend on screen size that kind of stuff okay should we pull off like the very first image of the product yeah they've only got there's only one so i've only added one for each product so we could just i guess you could just map over it or you could you could just kind of destructure it if you want yeah that yeah that'll work okay and then this is like that url right and then i would have done that if you were kind of you could have done that if you were mapping over the product images over here yeah um i think that would have been more readable um yeah so i think i know the issue here um the issue is gonna be essentially we actually have to do a bit of configuration for next image to work okay in the root of the project we just need a next.config.js file and just do a module exports and it's image i believe could be images and it's like domains um which is an array and then i think it's our cds media.graphcms.com so that's essentially saying we're safe to load assets from this this url this url okay i see nice yeah okay so it's good to see if i guess it's good to kind of uh safe safe list them allow them sure and then i saw like that we could specify device sizes and image sizes are those going to like kind of work out of the box does it have some defaults that will yes there is a default configuration that will apply and it's kind of the most common kind of breakpoints you would expect so yeah those we haven't overwritten those just by kind of adding this um this config parameter um those those defaults will still apply so you don't need to worry about that so much i think i did this import wrong this should be like this maybe yeah that's right yeah mix that up like every single day i mix up like yeah yeah it's that's yeah that's a default expo boom product page with an image nice okay beautiful look at that logo it's so pretty i want this hat i know i don't even have that hat i have to go i might have to go buy from the swag store right after this you know when it's uh i actually need to enable the fulfillment yeah doesn't actually do anything yet uh we just kind of set up with test uh test keys of stripe we went back into graph cms like is this this height and width i assume is set in graph cms yeah yeah so that's just the the metadata of the image so let's just pull from the the actual asset oh got it that's i don't have to specify that at all it's just kind of pulled from the the image details i don't i don't really know enough about images to okay but all right so that's how you can uh build some product pages out we're going to go into the next section here the in the video that follows this we'll show you how to redirect to stripe checkout i think you're really going to like it\", metadata={'source': 'GHW-gmj9ZwU', 'title': 'Next.js,

'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] in this episode we cover foundational topics and dig into the basics of ruby on rails the web framework how it works how we use rails as a base for some stripe developer office hours episodes and also in the stripe samples a collection of github repositories demonstrating integrations with many stripe products you may be just getting started and are curious about how to build an application from scratch to take your first online payment this episode will cover basics to help you get started quickly with ruby on rails if you already have a back end set up and are comfortable adding new routes and are now looking to add a stripe integration you may want to check out other office hours episodes where we show how to integrate specific stripe products and features similarly if you're looking for an introduction to a more like minimal web framework in ruby i'd recommend taking a look at sinatra we have another episode covering getting started with sinatra so why why rails rails is an opinionated feature-rich and popular web framework it includes everything needed to create a database-backed web application demos created with rails allow us to leverage rails conventions and the built-in orm or object relational model to build these data backed demos and they also help us demonstrate things like csrf or cross-site request forgery authentication background jobs sending emails and stuff like that so features that are more challenging to show with minimal web frameworks because while they're possible in a framework like sinatra or express you have to use third-party libraries to solve these same problems if you're already working with a more minimal framework like sinatra or express the same fundamentals we cover in this episode will apply but are implemented a little bit differently across a bigger more opinionated code base today we'll cover setting up a basic front end with the standard built-in html.erb files in another future episode we'll go into more detail about how to set up a front-end framework like react to work with rails it might be helpful to watch and refer to some other episodes before watching this one namely the introduction to the stripe cli as a quick agenda for today what we're going to cover is configuring your api keys and an initializer to get set up we're going to show how to set up a basic front end with a static html file and stripe.js installed and we'll show uh you know working with these dependencies in the gem file implementing some basic routes and connecting those to the front end so you can make requests from your front end to the back end and finally we'll wrap up with a web hook handler or how to set up your web hooks controller so i'm going to start from scratch here in the terminal i'm going to use the rails new command to create a brand new rails application here we're going to call it office hours rails so my preferred database is postgres but rails has several flavors of database that it supports like sqlite mysql etc etc so i'm going to say rails new office hours dash dash database is equal to postgresql i'm going to say dash t to skip tests by default rails uses mini test while i prefer r spec i can also say dash dash skip skip turbo links and dash dash skip listen turbo links is for this is preventing the installation of turbo links preventing the configuration of some dependencies that uh work with the listen gem which has a couple of issues i've noticed with some unix environments so we're just going to skip that okay so this is going to take a moment to install all the dependencies and create all the files we want and some front-end assets okay great our install of the new rails application is complete we're gonna change directory here into office hours rails and i'm just gonna open this up so that we can look at the directory structure so here in uh in the app directory this is where all of your application code will live assets is your javascript css files channels is for um action cable this is if you're doing sort of like real time communication with the front and back end controllers is where your controllers will live rails is an mvc framework model view controller so this is where your controllers live helpers are sort of like mix-ins that you can use with your views and your controllers we probably will not use helpers as part of any office hours episodes you can put some javascript here in this javascript directory um we'll talk much more about this when we talk about front-end frameworks like rails or i'm sorry react or vue or angular etc jobs is where we put the classes responsible for running background tasks so this is like the background jobs directory mailers is for classes that are responsible for sending emails models is our data models the classes that allow us to interact with the database but often times people will put you know plain old ruby objects into these model files and then finally we have a views directory with some template files these are html.erb templates that is embedded ruby on top of html moving on down the list here we've got a config we're going to talk about initializers but in here you'll also notice a master dot key file this file allows us to encrypt and decrypt the credentials file we're going to talk about credential management because we need to set our stripe api keys we also have down here the database which just contains a seeds.rb file common to edit that we probably will not look at or work with anything else that's in here just know that it's there and it's useful and you might encounter some need to change some files elsewhere but for the purposes of developer office hours we're mostly going to be working within that app directory and kind of configuring our initializers and setting up some some basic routes controllers and models let's use the credential management to set our api key we can set an environment variable here called editor and i'm going to set that to vi um this could be your editor of choice visual studio code atom sublime emacs whatever but then the command we run is rails credentials colon edit and this will rails credentials colon edit will decrypt that credentials file this is a just encrypted yaml file so we're going to decrypt it using the master key and this will allow us to edit the yaml and when you save it it'll be re-encrypted so here i can say stripe secret key is my secret key you can find your api keys in the stripe dashboard and we have some episodes about authentication uh where we go in more depth here but generally we'll have three things here a secret key public key and a web hook secret and those are these are sort of my test keys this is how we set up the api keys for the demo your setup may vary and could support multiple environments for for instance production and development or similar so for demos we're always going to just set these test keys at the top level in the yaml block like so all right now if i close this file and save it that will re-encrypt the file so that we have some encrypted credentials next we want to install some dependencies which we can do by opening the gem file which is at the root of the application here at the bottom i'm going to add obviously gem stripe this will install the stripe ruby gem the ruby bindings in the development group i also like to use pry rails and annotate which are a couple of helpful gems for just working in development and then finally we're gonna un comment the bcrypt the bcrypt gem because in some demos we will use bcrypt for encrypting for instance passwords okay we can close the gem file and run bundle install that will install our dependencies when you run a rails application it'll first load the framework in any gems for the application so the gems that we just loaded those will be loaded after the application is loaded then it'll load these files called initializers they live in config initializers you can generally use initializers to hold configuration settings that should be made after all the framework and gems are loaded so for instance setting your api key so here in config initializers there's a directory with several initializers already we want to add a new one called stripe stripe.rb and in here we will globally set our api key to configure the stripe ruby client that way when we make api requests to the stripe api using stripe ruby they will all be authenticated with this globally set api key okay we do this by or we can access the credentials that we set in that yml file by going through rails.application.credentials.stripe because that was the top level key and then we need to index into this with uh the name of the key that was underneath stripe so remember recall that it said stripe and then underneath that we had secret key like this this is what the yaml file looked like so here when we say rails.application.credentials that accesses the file at the top level dot stripe gets us into this level and then by passing in the this symbol here for secret key that'll allow us to pull out the stripe secret key and set that api key so now we can close that all right so at this point we should be able to make api calls to the stripe api so running rails console or simply rails c will give us an interactive shell where we can experiment with objects that are loaded inside of the rails application so the stripe ruby gem should be loaded our api key should be set and we should be able to access and work with the stripe api directly from our terminal so here we can say something like stripe price dot list and you'll see that we get back a list of prices that are connected to my stripe account you can also say something like stripe customer dot create and pass in an email address jenny rosen at example.com i'm not sure why i capitalized the j and are there in that email but you'll see that we do get a response back from the stripe api we just created a brand new customer so we're interacting directly with the stripe api in the in the terminal here in this interactive shell uh through the rails console okay so it looks like uh all of our api keys are configured we've got our dependencies installed everything is working we're able to talk to stripe the final dependency we'll install is stripe.js in rails application there's a there's a file called application.html.erb where the master html layout file is generally the file which wraps all other views and is where we want to install stripe.js so let me show you where that belongs where that lives under apps views layouts there's application.html.erb technically we can install stripe.js anywhere as long as it's loaded before we try to use it it is best practice to load stripe.js on every single page that's why we want to put it in this application html erb i like to put it in the head above these other javascript include tags so i'm going to just add this here this way if we write any javascript in application.js for instance then stripe.js will be loaded first i have also seen folks cut this and put it down below so that it's executing after the body loads this is another practice that i've seen before then you'll notice that when we create other views this yield command is where those like partial templates will be rendered into so this is where we call yield and where most templates are going to render into so first for office hours we typically have this standard html that we put in all templates and that allows us to have a little bit of structure and shape and then that works along with some demo css that we have for all office hours episodes this is excellent now we have like a rough outline of what an application with dependency installed and stripe ruby configured stripe.js configured for us to begin making api calls so next we're going to create a controller and some associated views to see how to handle requests we can say rails generate controller or we can even simplify this to rails g controller orders and say no helper and no assets generally you'll have a model and a controller that kind of have a similar name so if you have an order model you have an orders controller if you have a posts model you'll have a posts controller if you have a customer model you might have a customers controller this is going to generate a new file with a class that's responsible for receiving and responding to requests specifically about orders so rails applications generally follow a very strong convention to help developers build applications faster controllers typically have one or many standard actions but can also have custom routes so let's open up this file and talk about what those standard actions are we have index show new create edit update and destroy okay so index this is where we list items so in this case we're going to be returning a list of orders generally here we return a single item here we return a form for creating an item create is where we actually receive a post request and actually create the item edit returns a form for updating an item and update is where we will receive the post request to change or the put put request patch request to change modify or update an existing item and then destroy just deletes an item okay so this is generally the way that standard actions are set up in rails index new show create edit update destroy so we have this class called orders controller and when we add these actions to the controller in order to route requests to the right controller action we have to update another file called routes.rb it's this configuration file which contains the list of path and controller action mappings so here we have routes.rb this is what it generally looks like to start with there's an entire dsl or domain specific language for defining the routes we're generally going to use this method called resources so you can say resources orders and this is going to create 7 standard path to controller action mappings so by saying resources orders here we will get the orders index so we can say for instance actually i'm going to pull up a graphic that helps explain this a bit more okay so this is in the official rails documentation you see that here it's saying resources photos remember that our controller is called order the orders controller and so when in the demo here it says resources photos and that creates these seven routes a route called slash photos which receives when receiving requests that are using the get http verb those will route to the index action on the photos controller in our case we have resources orders so if you go to slash orders you make a get request to slash orders it will call the order controller index action and return a list of orders that's what it's supposed to be just conventionally separately if you if you do slash order slash new or slash photo new that will be a get request that hits the new route and generally returns a form to create a new order or a new photo we have the same thing with post so if you send a post request to slash photos it will use that create method to create a new photo get with photos slash id so this is like photo slash one photo slash two similarly with orders order slash one order slash two that will use the show method in the photos controller the show action in the photos controller get for slash photo slash id edit this again returns the form for editing or updating the photo this will use the edit method on the controller patch if you send a patch or put request to photo id this will update that photo sending a delete to photo slash id that will destroy that photo so this convention follows for orders and for our controller because we named our controller orders controller and we used this method called resources orders we are able to um out of the box we get these seven methods that we can use and these are the paths to make the requests that will map to those controller actions let's go back to our orders controller here and add a method that will handle requests to the index so if we just say maybe like orders is a list of 1 2 3 4 and 99 and then we say render json of orders this is saying when we receive a request to slash orders because we have we've mapped this in our routes file when we receive a request to slash orders call this index method by default right now we're not going to do anything with the incoming request other than just know that we were asked for a list of orders and then down here we can call render and in this case the the the format that we're rendering back is json and we're passing just an array this array of orders oftentimes if you're working with active record this will be orders equals order dot all and that will fetch all the orders and then return the json for those but for our example right now we don't actually have a model yet so we are simply going to return the json for those orders all right so we've talked a lot about getting our application configured but we haven't yet started the application so we can use rails s or rails server to start the application this will boot up the app by default it's going to use puma for this version of rails and now it's listening on port 3000 so if we went to the browser and went to localhost 3000 and refresh the page you'll get this yay you're on rails sort of default template this is coming from index.html that's in the public directory generally you pretty pretty quick after installing and setting up rails we're going to go back into that routes routes.rb file and configure it so that when we make requests to the root route we receive a different html template so right now if we go to slash orders though we get back the json and uh that's that's all looking great so this is how we can add a method to the server which returns some json in this case orders now if we wanted to we could modify this so that it was maybe it's a list of like keys or uh you know maybe it's an object here maybe we have two objects you know thing is stuff okay all right so now if we come back over here and refresh the page all that json is going to come back just as json in the javascript object uh all right so that is looking that's looking okay it's looking alright so hopefully that helps helps map the methods that are on a controller to the routes file the next thing i wanted to do was create a new controller and this is going to be a very special controller which only handles requests that are coming in for the root route just for the slash so i'm going to say rails g controller static pages i'm going to name the view root so when you're generating a controller you can pass a list of names after the the name of the controller and these will be created as methods on the controller they'll also be created as routes in the routes file so that's that can be that can be helpful no assets okay so we're creating another file here called static pages and it will have a method called root you'll notice that there was also a file here in app view static pages called root.html that we will that we will uh play with in a bit um so let's go to the routes file you'll notice that it added this get request for static pages root we're going to delete that and add root um static pages root root is another special method in the domain specific language for specifying routes where you are just it you can only call it one time and it's just for the the slash so if i remove um orders here i should return the static pages root okay so we've got our we have the root of our application here living at static pages in app view static pages root let's head over here and update this so that our header says developer office hours static pages root so this is what the the the file that was generated because we used the rails g controller static pages and we passed in that root method here we're going to say developer office hours so now we have this root file if we refresh the page you'll see developer office hours that all looks great and this is working as expected now let's go back into the static pages root file and make a button that when clicked will send a post request to create a new order rails g model order and for now let's say that it just has a a stripe id and a status okay so here we can use the again rails generate and this time we're generating a model not a controller so we say rails g model order and then we can pass in all the fields that we want so by default you can also specify a type so if the stripe id was an integer we could specify integer you can also specify string text boolean there's several different ways that you can specify the default is just string so stripe ids are strings statuses are also strings we might have maybe a paid at which is a date time so we can we can do this when we hit enter this will create two things this will create the class file for an order in order.rb and it will also create a migration a database migration for us called create orders the create orders migration is again a dsl or a domain specific language for writing migration so this is going to convert this create table method is going to convert from ruby into the database manipulation language code so the the code that will modify the database by creating a table or updating a table or removing a column or you can create a table called orders it's going to have three column or three columns that we've specified the stripe id status and paydat and then by saying t.timestamps that will add a created at and updated that field automatically for us and rails will keep track of all of those things so by default there's actually a third or a final thing that's created for us by default and that is an id it's an autumn incrementing integer id by default and so all of that will be created for us just by specifying the table like so another thing that we might do is say add index and then you set you pass the name of the table and the column that you want to index on stripe id it might be that we want to look up orders really really frequently with the stripe id and this will by adding an index this will speed up the lookup by making the database more performant we can also add other other options here so we can specify that this should be unique by saying unique true so this this is a pattern that you might see in office hours episodes okay i'm going to close that file and the way that we run this is we say rake db migrate which will run the migration against our database and create a new table in the database so this created a brand new order table i'm not going to go into too much detail about active record but i do want to go back to our orders controller and update this so that rather than rendering the list of items like that we're saying orders is order.all for the index and that should be a good spot for us to start okay so now what we have is uh in our orders controller let's also add a create method here so we're going to say at order is equal to order dot new order params if the order was saved then we want to render the json for the order otherwise we want to render the errors okay so this is super simple you might be wondering where this order params thing came from it doesn't exist yet so we're going to define it down here generally it's a private method on the controller order params this is again just a convention to name it order underscore or like because we're in an orders controller we're going to or name it order underscore preamp if we were in a photos controller we would call it photos underscore params so here we're going to say params.require order dot permit status and paid at and stripe id what we're doing here is specifying which parameters are allowed to be set on an order when we create it so this is how we sort of this is called strong parameters if you want to look up more about the the rails framework and how it's set up this is called strong params for now i'm just gonna sort of wave my hand and let you know that this this is something that you want to do generally this will um mean that the the json or the request that's coming in looks like this order points at and then that's what this required does is requires that there's a top level order key in the params requires a top level order key and then permit status is like paid paid at is some time stamp and the stripe id is you know some payment intent id uh possibly right this this is what the shape of the incoming params could look like so this is uh this is allowing that to be permitted now if we did not want the user to be able to set the stripe id for some reason maybe that's something or we didn't want them to set the status maybe we don't want a user to be able to pass in the status from the front end to automatically mark an order as paid then what we could do is remove status from what's allowed to be set here and instead set it a different way so we can set it by just calling order.status directly on the order method all right so now that we have this order create method let's try to create an order let's try to create an order object so from our front end um in static pages root i want to add a button and for now i'm just going to call it create order and i'm going to add a script tag just in line here where we're going to grab reference to the button so here i'm using document.queryselector and passing in the css selector so the hashtag says refer to these the html element with its id being equal to button or btn and then i'm going to say on click of this button create an order so i'm going to send a post request to slash orders right because our orders we have that slash orders is where we're receiving post requests so a post to slash orders will result in the execution of the orders controller create method because we use this resources orders and the next thing we want to do is we will just we'll just console.log the data that we get back so here we want to pass we want to pass in maybe a status of paid we want to pass in maybe paid at one two three four five six seven eight nine actually let's see df now okay sure that's a little better and then maybe we want to pass in uh the stripe id is pi pi123 okay so this this will make a post request from the client using ajax or using the fetch api when that request gets to the server the server is going to handle it in the orders controller the create method of the orders controller will execute a new order will be created and then saved to the database and we're going to receive the json for the order back then the client will resolve the promise and the data will be this order object let's give it a whirl so if we go back to the browser and click refresh we'll see a new button here and if we open the the developer tools which we can do by right-clicking and going to inspect we can see in the console so there's several tabs here super super helpful if we go to sources we can see the content of the javascript that we have just written if you click on the gutter so on any of the numbers here in the gutter that'll create a break point that will allow us to kind of like inspect the code as it's executing so i'm adding a breakpoint on line 25 because that is right inside of the function callback to the click the click event listener the add event listener method as soon as we click on this button this function should execute so we should hit this breakpoint so when i click on create order it does and it's broke you know the the javascript debugger broke on that line i removed the breakpoint by clicking the line again now i'm going to add another breakpoint to line 39 because the next step here is going to make a post request to this to slash orders to create an order object and then we should get back the order but i've i've skipped one step so it's going to error out but let's see okay so we got an error it says unexpected token here in the console unexpected token uh square bracket at position whatever we got a 422 unprocessable entity that's the the http status code is 422. so if we look at the network tab and click on orders we see this big red error that says action controller invalid authenticity token so in rails they protect from cross site request forgery with this concept of an authenticity token so every request every post request that's received by default should have this authenticity token now there's two things we can do number one we can disable this authenticity token checking not recommended because then you lose your csrf protection which is helpful for preventing fraud preventing people from you know ddosing you preventing several different things just it's it's really important and really common to have csrf checking on a production web application so you want to have it generally turned on the other way we can get around this is by passing the authenticity token in the request that we're sending along so authenticity token is form authenticity token okay so there uh if we include this authenticity underscore token parameter when we're making our request and its value is set to um some string that is available by calling the form authenticity token rails helper method because we're in html.erb we have access to this csrf token and we're able to just put that directly in the code i'm also noticing that i forgot to nest these under order so i'm going to add that too so order is these things okay so all right let's let's try it again if we refresh the page and we go back to sources let's take a look here you'll notice that the authenticity token this string is now filled out right here okay so the authenticity token is again part of preventing csrf i think you can also put it in the header but generally i just put it directly in the request body because rails has this convention of separating out the content that you're sending to create an object as uh by nesting it underneath that key so let's click this button again and see what happens we again have an error this time it's a 500 okay so let's look at the network tab go to orders undefined method or local variable order params order params oh i misspelled it okay so let's go back to our orders controller okay refresh the page click create again all right so now we're in the successful callback here and you'll see that we did get our order back um what's interesting is that uh or like the thing that's of note is that now we have a created at and an updated ad that are full um full timestamps so this was they created that updated at an id are all managed directly by rails and were created for us so now we have this concept of of an order still this order has nothing to do with stripe we are just simply showing how to do crud how to uh make requests from the front end to the back end and vice versa so here we have created in order the next thing i want to do is show how we might fetch orders so let's go back to our static pages root and from here we can add another um some more some more logic here at the bottom so before we do that let's see so at the top of this page i'm going to add a ul with the id of orders and it'll just be empty initially because what we're going to do is fetch the orders using ajax using this fetch api and then we'll populate the list of orders and show just the id and the created at in the list okay so at the bottom of our script here i'm going to grab reference to that orders ul and next i'm going to make a fetch request this time it's a get request so by default fetch if it's a get request you do not need to specify the method or the headers or body or whatever so we're going to make this get request to slash orders and we expect that the data we get back is a list of orders and we'll say something like orders dot for each order and we want to create maybe orders ul dot inner html plus equals um some li uh yeah we'll just we're just kind of playing around here so this is going to be ordered id and from ordered created at and then we'll close the li and this should sort of build up that orders ul as it's going so let's see so if i if we hit refresh here uh we got a 500 uh cool all right so then go to the network tab we come to let's see clear clear let's make sure we're working with the same stuff here so we hit right when the page loads we should be hitting the orders the orders endpoint as a get request and we did and we did get back a list of orders here it looks like those did not actually populate this ul though so let's add some breakpoints here so when we refresh the page this document.queryselector is running let's see the orders ul it seems like it has an id so we're going to fetch orders and then when we get into here for each order orders is a list okay um and then what is order yeah order has that id so enter is it oh you know what i think this might be capitalized all right let's see uh yeah okay cool um so created at all right so refresh the page here and now we have one that's the id of the order from and this is you know the date so this is great if we click create order again uh and then refresh the page we should have a second order i thought uh we're getting errors here what are our errors um record not unique ah the stripe id has to be unique okay so um let's say our stripe id is now um i don't know new date let's see what happens okay so i think we created an order refresh the page okay so now we've got a new order from that date create an order refresh the page we've got order number five all right so this looks like it's totally working um as expected that's kind of how you how you can both send and receive data from the back end that's kind of really the basics for getting started with making requests in rails and kind of all you need to know in terms of the basics for working with rails for developer office hours except for web hooks so let's move on to web hooks last and we'll we'll wrap up by demonstrating how you can work with with web hook with a web hooks controller okay so a web hook is a notification or it's a combination of a bunch of different tools so a web hook consists of a web hook endpoint and web hook notification so when events happen on your stripe account you can be notified of those so a web hook endpoint is this route on your server to which stripe will send post requests we know from creating our orders controller that we can create a create method a method called create in the orders controller and that will receive post requests and that allows us to create order objects similarly with web hooks we can create a webhooks controller and in the create action of our webhooks controller we can receive post requests so i'll say railsg controller webhooks no helper no assets and we don't need any views users do not see any part of a web hook a web hook is purely for some third party to send you a notification so if you go to our web hooks controller here and add a create method this is where we're going to receive post from stripe or another third party okay we need we also need to go to our routes.rb file and set up a a method so we can receive posts to slash webhooks to webhooks create similarly you might see us use resources web hooks only create these two are one in the same so by specifying only that will say only create the routes or only create the paths that will map to one single method that way people you know there's no way to like retrieve web hooks there's no way to see a single instance of an event created from a web hook or similar so what's nice about using resources if is if in the future you decided that you wanted a way to maybe destroy a web hook or something then you could add delete or destroy here or show or something so you could extend this by using resources and just easily adding a new method to that to this this only list all right so we are receiving post requests from stripe here we've got our route set up the way that this works is when we receive a post request from stripe we will generally automate something so when um here there's an entire list of event types here so let's take a look at the event types so under in the api reference under types of events you'll see a huge list of possible event types that are going to happen or be fired on your event so account.updated is an example a balance being available is an example one of the most common is checkout session completed this is a very common webhook event tie for people to automate based on because this is when someone has successfully paid through stripe checkout the stripe hosted checkout page there's several several other events that you might listen for event types that you might listen for and automate based on so for instance you might send an email when an invoice is paid these are the types of things that you would set up web hooks for so we are now going to we're going to build this create method and i'm actually going to start from the web hook controller or the web hook documentation here under check signatures i'm going to go down to the ruby code this code is written in like for sinatra this post do this is for sinatra but the code is quite easy to translate so we'll i'll just copy this and then we can work with this so what does this look like all right so at the beginning we are getting the payload we want to use request.body.read so that we have the most raw version of the payload that's coming in the reason is that we want to do some signature verification of the web hook so down here when we say stripe web hook construct event we pass in the payload a signature header so in the post request that comes from stripe it's going to have this stripe signature in the header and that signature is a a inc when you combine your web hook signing secret with the signature that came from stripe you can double check to make sure that this post request didn't come indeed come from stripe and not some malicious third party who is just kind of sending post requests to your web hook endpoint so our endpoint secret is available in rails credentials under webhook secret because we said this earlier okay if uh deserializing the event fails because it's invalid json we want to render json back to stripe and say error or message e with a 400 status code anything that's not 200 including redirects will result in a failed web hook event from stripes perspective and they will retry we'll retry with exponential back off for several days okay so this is this is where we're extracting the entire raw payload from the request body then we are pulling out the stripe signature header from the request headers request.n allows us to access the headers then we are looking in the rail application credentials for the webhook signing secret that we set earlier here we're setting event we're creating a variable called event and setting it equal to nil so that when we're done with this begin rescue end block we still have access to the event the scope variable scoping in ruby is block block scoping and when you enter a begin block uh the we would lose reference to this variable if we didn't have you know reference in the parent scope so we create the we create event equals nil here so that we have access to the event after we're done with this begin rescue and try catch block okay at the very bottom this is very common we'll have a case statement a case when or a switch where we check um we we switch based on the event type so we're basically saying like if the event type is payment intent succeeded run this block if the event type is payment method attached run this block etc etc so you can really easily add several different event types that you want to listen for let's call that good and then finally we want to render json back that says maybe message just success and that will be rendered back to stripe remember that the the only way that this endpoint is called is directly by stripe one of the things that we talked about earlier was csrf protection or cross-site request forgery protection and uh recall that we passed in the form authenticity token when we were making an ajax call from our front end to our back end so that we knew and we kind of like had confidence that the request the post request that was incoming was from a site that we owned because we rendered that form authenticity token directly into the page and that authenticity token is going to change every time the page loads so because there is no page that's loading on stripes server when they're making a request to our web hooks controller we need to disable csrf protection on the webhooks controller so we can do that with skip before action verify authenticity verify authenticity token so there's this concept of before actions and after actions and rails which are methods that will run sort of before your method is encountered and after your method is encountered and by saying skip before action here we're we're calling this class method at the very top level and passing in the the symbol for the before action that we want to skip over so verify authenticity token is basically just disabling csrf so disable um csrf token checking okay next we want to we're going to use the stripe cli stripe listen dash dash forward to uh localhost 3000 slash hook looks so the stripe cli is a tool for building and testing web hooking or stripe integrations we have a really handy tool in stripe listen that allows you to set up a direct connection between your stripe account and your local machine so that when events happen on your stripe account they're forwarded to your local running web server so we are going to just leave this running in a tab in our terminal and this will form a direct connection in practice when you go to production you'll want to go create a webhook endpoint in the stripe dashboard that points to your production url but in test mode and in development this is really the best way to uh to test and build your web hooks so what we've got going on here is we have this direct connection when an event fires on our stripe account it's going to trigger this listener which will forward a post request to our web hooks controller because again this slash web hooks when we receive a post request to slash webhooks our routes.rb file has specified resources webhooks which matches this webhook's controller name and knows to call the create method so we've got all this set up let's open another tab and there's a separate stripe cli test tool called trigger so i can say stripe trigger checkout dot session dot completed and this will fire several api calls which will result in a checkout.session.completed event firing so several event several other events will also fire so we're going to get checkout session completed payment um you know payment method attached etc etc so if we look in this is the listen tab the tab where we have our stripe listener set up you can see several different events happened here including this checkout session completed event so these are all being forwarded to our web hook endpoint you can see that it was a post request to localhost 3000 webhooks here was the event id that was fired and we got a 200 status code in the response and it tells you like when it when it happened so if we then look in the the server logs for our running application you'll see that we receive these post requests for localhost at this time and it's being processed by the webhooks controllers create method as xml is just the default and here was all the data for the event that was fired from stripe and this allows us to automate things like sending emails or you know pulling from inventory or printing shipping labels or things like that i think i'm gonna wrap it there you should now be uh fully equipped to at least follow along in some of the stripe developer office hours episodes where we use ruby on rails uh and uh yeah some hopefully you were able to take away some best practices in terms of where to set your api key how to manage credentials and a couple other tips and tricks around uh how i work with ruby on rails so please if you have any questions comments concerns reach out we're on irc in the free no network in the stripe channel also happy to chat on twitter at stripe dev or at cjav underscore dev all right until next time\", metadata={'source': 'vULdSKCUhOs', 'title': 'Ruby on Rails starter', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3703,

is um the simplest way to integrate with stripe um and despite that simplicity you get a lot of payment functionality for your efforts for example uh checkout supports digital wallets like apple pay and google pay if you're taking card payments in europe uh checkout is sca ready so um stripe will take care of 3ds authentication for you um you get access to many different types of local payment methods like fpx in malaysia or ideal in the netherlands to name a few and all of that localized into more than 25 languages and optimized for screen sizes from desktop all the way down to mobile welcome to developer office hours my name is matt ling i'm a developer support engineer here at stripe and in today's integration we're going to build um checkout integration using sepa debit so let's take a quick look um at an example of what we're going to build here we have um my store and if i click to purchase this photo print we'll be redirected over to stripe where we enter some payment information i'm going to grab a valid iban since we're using sepa okay um add some billing information and click to pay and we should be redirected back out to the start page okay so let's um let's build that um okay so i'll start out by bootstrapping a ruby and sinatra project using the stripe cli uh using the developer office hours template and we'll call it checkout i'll choose ruby and then we get a basic project um to start with okay i have some prepared html and css which i'll check copy into the clients directory client directory brother okay um okay i'm gonna remove this uh index.html file which we don't need okay so on the root um i'm going to render the index erb here we can say this is a sepa um zebra debit okay um let's start the server okay um then we can go ahead and we should see yeah so this is the same index uh erb that we had before and when i click on the button will be post we post rather to the redirect route and so i can go ahead so this is the first thing we need to do is actually create the checkout session for your customer post direct and so that's going to be a stripe checkout session create and this takes an options hash um the mode is going to be payment um because checkout supports uh one-time payments but also starting subscriptions which is really useful um the payment method types um in this case we are going to use sepadebus um so we definitely need to provide um an array of line items so normally you would dynamically generate this list based on a cart or something similar [Music] all right so we have a price and i'm going to grab the price i've already created on the dashboard but i'll go and grab that now and quantity let's just purchase one um all right so price and i'm going to put it into the environment variables or we can just hard code it why not um okay jump into the dashboard so here's my photo print and i've got um photopine product and it has a euro price of 10 books 10 euros um okay um actually no let's put this into the environment variables because the code that is hosted on um github will have a placeholder for you um so this example by the way is uh hosted at github under developer office hours and in stripe samples so you can go ahead and actually follow along if you'd like to um all right price okay oops i'll grab it here again okay um right and nice okay so that's our price configured um we also need to give it a success url let's come back to localhost to the um the start page um i could also just say like success that's true the same goes for canceling if the user cancels out of the checkout session okay just do a double check price and the mode is payment we're using sap debit the line items and success and cancel url okay cool so what we can do is uh tell the logs for the account and and see if i should posting that to posting back to the uh redirect route actually creates yeah um it's line items plural let's try that again okay that does seem to have worked and here we can see okay the log set yeah http 200. um it's been created okay um so the next thing to do is now that we have a valid session we need to redirect the user to um to strive using strike.js so let's save the session id into a variable and we're going to render then the redirect view yeah redirect.erb i'm gonna steal a line from in here nice um and here we need to initialize drive.js and the publishable key is stored in the environment variables let's get rid of that okay okay let's try and then we redirect to check out passing the session id that we just um created [Music] a session this one okay so if we restart the server and repost this form yeah we end up on checkout cool so we can provide this information here okay and pay and because um sepa debit is an asynchronous payment method asynchronous meaning um we don't immediately know the outcome of the payment we need to listen out on a web book endpoint um to know when uh when a payment either has succeeded or failed um so let's jump into the back end again um and the developer office hours template um gave us this web hook for free um but the most important part um that's going on here is uh this construct event method where we provide the raw body of the um post event the webhook signing secret and then the header that and stripe sends along um and here um the the header the header is recalculated the signature's recalculated and compared and if that checks out then we know that the event came from stripe um so and here for we are checking the event types and we are essentially interested in three the checkout session completed so you know that somebody um checked out uh check out completed and we're also interested in two others um namely if the payment fails succeeds or fails um that happens async async payment succeeded okay we can report that too payment so exceeded um let's copy that actually and failed okay so more uh here's where you would um finally provision your service or um complete an order because you know that the uh debit actually went through and or here you could for example contact your customer to let them know that um something's gone wrong okay let's just um we're going to leverage the stripe cli again to listen out for um events i'm going to forward them to this webhook endpoint okay so let's go and check out again i use this ipad again and then if we inspect the events that are created we can see here at the checkout session the check i completed and then eventually we should see that the um the payment succeeds and that's what's happened here yeah so that was another short and sweet integration with stripe um it really is kind of a testament to the simplicity and power of check out how easy it is to integrate with stripe and add new payment methods um if you have any questions comments or feedback please do contact us we'll be thrilled to hear from you you can get us on support.stripe.com or jump into our irc channel on freenode and so yeah thanks again for joining us and until next time stay safe you\", metadata={'source': 'ekU_4WkeD9A', 'title': 'SEPA Direct Debit with Checkout', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3818, 'thumbnail_url':

back to the stripe developers youtube channel my name is thor and today i'm joined by my colleague sheng wei and today we want to look at building a native android payment integration with firebase cloud functions um if you follow us on our stripe dev twitter account uh you might have seen that we've built some firebase extensions that you can find in the firebase marketplace and for example here we have an extension that allows you to run subscription payments with stripe and the extension brings all the cloud functions and the synchronization with cloud firestore and authentication custom setting of rules and such however if you're familiar with building native applications you might know that for certain projects you have to use the in-app payment apis from google or apple and specifically that's when you're selling subscriptions um in the application or in-game currencies game levels access to premium content uh so if you're upselling content within the app then you have to use the inner payment apis however if you're selling a physical goods or services outside of the apis sorry services outside of the app then you can use stripe to process payments in your native applications and so today today what we want to look at is the um android uh basic integration with our android sdks pre-built ui this ui allows you to collect card details securely in a pci compliant manner as well as billing address details and then automatically stores these details on a customer object and when the customer is authenticated we can then show a list of stored payment methods to that customer and so in order to get started with with this we have a sample here on the stripe samples organization we're going to link that in the description below and so let's just go ahead and clone this down to our local machine great and let's hop in there so i'll open this with vs code here on my local machine here got the readme set up and so the first thing that we need to do is create a new firebase project in the firebase developer console so let's go ahead and do that let's call this firebase android payments sounds good let's not enable google analytics for now and spin up the new project in the meantime we can have a look at the next steps um so specifically when we communicate with the stripe api from our cloud functions we do need to switch to the blaze plan which is the pay as you go you still get a good amount of um free stuff there uh but uh yeah you need to switch to the pay as you go plan so now the project is ready we can step in here so let's simply upgrade to pay as you go let's go ahead great and as a next step so we want to use authentication we do need the authentication to make sure that the user is actually logged in and authenticated when they want to access their storage payment details and so uh in the authentication settings we need to um enable a sign-in method for us here we can just use email and password for now and you can also enable other off method like google or facebook twitter and such so now we got all of that enabled and then uh we will need the firebase cli to actually deploy our project so i've already logged into my firebase account so what we can do now is simply in my functions folder here i have my project details and so um let's go ahead and run always use add and we want to associate this project great and so what you can see now is that we've got a firebase dot firebase rc file uh with our project details that will be used for deployment and in the next step we'll need to install the dependencies for our functions so again here you can see uh the dependencies we get some logging firebase admin firebase functions and the stripe a node library to make uh api requests to stripe uh we're running uh note 10 here in our project and if we step into the function uh real quick you can see here that we're setting up the stripe node client in our project with the stripe secret key and so we need to set that to be accessible in our functions as a secret so the way we do that is using the firebase cli as well so we can set the secret and for this you'll need your stripe account so we've created a stripe account here a fresh one uh just a test account and in the developer settings the api keys now um make sure you don't show your secret keys to anyone that's very important so here this is in test mode so we're not going to blur it out but do not share your life key please great and now that we have um the secret set up the last step we can go ahead and we can deploy our project and here we are only uh deploying the functions uh because we don't have a hosting uh or web project and so so here you can see uh the different functions that we have we're going to step through them in detail later on so we have a function to create a stripe customer to create an informal key we're gonna dive into what that actually means and then we have a create stripe payment we want to handle webhook events when payments succeed or fail for example and then lastly we have a cleanup user a function that when our user wants to be deleted from our application we also take care of the cleaning app in the stripe account great and now our deploy is complete so we can now jump into our firebase project and we can look at all the functions that have been deployed and that is the ones that we just stepped through that's great so now we got the functions ready um and so in the next step what we'll need to do is set up our android project and here i'm going to hand over to xingwei thanks so um so here what we are going to build is something like this we are going to make use of the file-based authentication ui to to create the assigned flows for your applications for example this will be the final results this is making use of the file-based authentication ui and we we are going to use the stripe basic integrations payment activities allow you to add new payment methods into the customer to in um to start the payment sessions as well as complete payments so these are a very simple ui flows we are going to build so let's get started with it the first things we are going to do is to start a new android projects it will be a simple empty activities we can name it as file based demo and we just leave that select the android apis versions as it is and finish it okay this empty object will create and main activities uh this is the ui with simple hardwoods and the main activities if you run it it will be as simple as displaying a text and we want to turn this into a functioning applications allow you to log in as well as making payments making use of the file-based authentication ui as well stripes android-based integrations so what we are going to do now is let's think let's just add because we're going to connect to file base let's go at the internet permissions so now we have we have a simple uh android applications with empty activities displaying hollywood and we are going to add these applications into our projects so what we are doing is now is add an engine we need to input the file based package name matching the file base applications that we have just created and give it a name or paste right demo and register the particular app file base will automatically generate json files which we need to add to the group which we need to add to sorry our android applications so after we download the google service confusion files let's add it to the applications folder this configuration file should resize on the same level as the build.gradle files so let's just edit okay uh this google service basically contains all the configurations necessary to connect to the file based project okay then as the step three we are going to add all the uh file based ui related packages first let's add to the project level uh build.gradle which will be here once we add it we can just let it sync first and in all the projects we need to have the google as the maven added as the repositories and let's just copy this guy to the apps build.gradles okay cool okay that's all uh that's all to add to the google um of the file based authentications services into these applications let's sync this again cool so what we are just now what we are going to build is a few buttons uh into our main applications let's just copy paste those into our layout files here this is a very simple uis where the sign buttons will be visible at the beginning all the rest will be hidden until user is authenticated and obviously we are going when we use a click signs will launch the file based on authentication ui so let's add the file-based authentication ui to the android projects so go to the build gradles we're going to add the file based ui files first sync it now let's go to the main activities file and hook up the button clicking events so when the login button is clicked what we are going to do is to bring up the the authentication ui which uh make use of the email authentication uh first okay so let's just give it um [Music] sign tag id and in the activity callbacks will be able to to get the authenticated user object so let's just add applications local rivals called cut current users okay cool let's just just uh coming out of this one first the show ui is basically um ui updaters uh utility functions allow us to show and hide the applications okay let's just copy paste this part cool yep let's just call your actual ui again okay let's try around these applications and see what it works so it's going to build a ui cool as you can see we are actually showing a sign of buttons when we click it to launch authentication ui provided by file based authentication framework let's just click sign now this is the preview ui of file based authentication libraries let's just test it as e this is a new emails and the firebase authentication will automatically detect this is a new email and ask user to create a new account for example let's just give a very simple password cool as you can see we we are successfully logging to google authentications and we are able to display the usernames now we are ready to uh to actually make use of the stripe basic integrations libraries to to add credit cards and the start payment sessions what we are going to do next is to to integrate with stripes basic integrations preview uis to use the preview uis actually we need to create a customer sessions which allow you to show a list of safe cut payment methods and allow you to add new copy informations into the customers as well as we provide the preview uis for connecting shipping information as well as billing addresses so in order to use uh these preview ui you need to use the e-form keys to establish a customer session this informal key is a short-lived secret which helps to create the customer sessions in the strike mobile sdk with the established customer sessions you could basically operating all these functions including adding deleting and remove updating the payment methods and connecting shipping and building informations thanks ringway yes so now we have our android project scaffolding setup we have firebase authentication hooked in with the authentication ui which allows us to um quickly sign up new users and um authenticate them later on in the application and as showing wayman mentioned with the thermal key in order to create that we need to provide a stripe customer id and we need to make sure that said customer is authenticated so that's how firebase authentication the stripey thermal key play together here so if we go back into our project we can now see that um the user that shengwei signed up is now available in our firebase authentication here and what we now need to do is we need to link this user this firebase user up with a stripe customer object and the way we do this is in the cloud functions so we can the way cloud functions work is there are a list of different triggers that we can use that we can hook into uh to execute our functions and for example here we can um hook into the oncreate for the firebase authentication user so when uh changue created that new user in firebase authentication we can then automatically execute this function uh with the context of this user and so what we want to do here is anytime a user signs up in our app we then want to create a customer object for them so using the stripe node client library we can create a customer object we can provide the email address it is not required so um we could also comment this out here and then one neat thing that we recommend you do is to provide the firebase a user id in the metadata of the stripe customer object and what this allows you to do is to search so the metadata is indexed in the stripe dashboard and it allows you to search for your customers using their firebase user id and then lastly what we do is we actually write to our firestore into the stripe customers collection we create a document for this particular user and then we set the customer id for them so you can think of this as a mapping table between the firebase user id and the customer id so now if we go back into our project we'd expect that to be in the database now because we have a new project we actually don't have a database yet and so we can actually see in the function uh locks here for create stripe customer we can look at the lock so when uh changue created that first user um our firebase function was uh triggered and you can see however here uh it says that where we don't have an active cloud data store or cloud firestore database so we need to create that so in our project just say create we're going to start in test mode which means we can um basically the firebase rules are disabled the security rules only do use that in in test mode in live mode you actually want to deploy some rules and now we're just going to use the default setting here us central now why that is provisioning we can actually look at some firestore rules that we should use for this project so in our database here we have documents we have a stripe customers collection and then for every user that signs up we will have a document in the stripe customers collection and so here is where the security rule comes in uh where we can say that only an authenticated user so where the request um the authentication object in the request matches the user id of the document only those are allowed to read and write to that and then nested underneath we have a sub collection called payments um and there we're going to have all the stripe payments that we create for this user and again we have the rule here that this sub collection can only be read by the particular user when they are authenticated so that way we can make sure that no one can access no user can access the other users data great so now we have our cloud firestore database set up and so now if um changue goes and signs up a new user so we can now see that we have a new user signed up here this is their firebase user id uh if we copy that and we go to our database we now have the stripe customers collection with a document for their specific user id and here we have a stripe customer object and if we go to the stripe dashboard as mentioned we can actually just put in the firebase user id in the search and we'll find the customer object for our user great so that is working all as expected so now that we have firebase authentication uh hooked up with our cloud function and our cloud firestore uh we can create a function to um create the thermal keys or the short lift key that the android payments ui needs to to show the relevant payment methods or add new payment methods so if we jump back into our functions what we do here is we create um what firebase calls a callable function so um from our project we can call this function and the great thing about this is that firebase automatically attaches the authentication context uh and data so here the creative thermal cloud function is a callable function and when it is being called we can check the context to have the authentication object included if it is not authenticated then we throw an error otherwise we pull out the user id from the authentication context and now as long as we have the user id we can now go into our firestore in the stripe customers collection we get the document for this specific user uh we get the data for it and there we have the custom id and so now we have the stripe customer id and we can pipe that into the uh stripe thermal keys create function we set our customer id and the android client also provides an api version this is important for different versions of the sdk to work correctly with the stripe api version and then at the end we have that key created and we return the key so in the context of the basic integration this is the step here where we set up the thermal key so the short lift key and specifically we've done the server-side part here with the uh callable function in firebase and so now shenghway is going to take us through uh the client-side side of things to create the sessions in our android client thank you thought so now the the iframework key has functions has been made in this in the server side on the client side we are going to call the firebase callable functions to get the firmware keys created for this particular customer the way to do it is we need to provide a informal key provider this could be find in in our guides at here in the client site because we are using clothing let's just do this let's create a new calling class called filebase the firmware key be provided and this information provider needs to implement informal key here yep before we're doing that the framework provider is part of the stripe uh libraries which are strap android libraries which obviously we need to include it in our gradle files so in this case let's just using our strong android version of 14.5 okay cool so we need to import the family key providers from stripe packages and yep then we need to overwrite the create informal keys provider functions and this uh great informal key functions uh uh needs to input api versions and callback functions we call the informal key update listeners which will be used by customer sessions cost to establish your customer sessions okay in this we are going to using the file-based functions functions libraries which we have already added these particular packages into into our dependencies and what we're going to do is to call firebase functions with multiplication and we are going to send the data of these particular api versions okay so this file base functions uh is calling the firebase callables of create from a keys which just has just been created by thor in our file based projects and when the when the functions returns we are going to retrieve the results as a string which we will send to the key update listeners so that in the main activities we are going to establish checkout sessions oh it's established uh customer sessions after we create the ufo wiki provider we're going to use uh inject this from a key provider to initialize the customer sessions uh the customer sessions in will be used to create a payment session and we can configure the payment sessions to connect shipping addresses or shipping methods or billing addresses and then we can even show google pay if the android applications support the google pay after the payment session has been initialized we could click start the the payment method selection uis allow you to add new payment method to the customers as well as selecting the existing method to complete the payments okay so this is what the final result will be look like first we create a new customer and this is a new user which does not exist in the firebase authentication database yet so we're going to create a new user for example of like user a and password give it one to six this will create a firebase user which in turn will create a customer in stripe account this then the strap android sdk will make use the ufo key provider to establish a customer session the customer sessions in turn was used to create a payment sessions which allow you to launch a series of android uis so for example one thing you can launch is to a list of existing payment methods belongs to this particular customer since this is a brand new customer obviously there's no payment method no credit cards saved yet what we can do is to save a new credit card to this customer okay let's just make use of 42.42 as you can see this credit card has been saved to this customer through the customer sessions and we can select obviously you can add new cards if you choose to and we can simply select this particular payment method and use it for payments so now we have successfully select a new payment methods for this particular user the next step is to complete a payment using this selected payment method so in order to use the selected payment method to complete a payment method of the payment sessions what we need to do is to create a payment intent uh in the server side in this case using file base so as sheng wei has mentioned we do uh need to create this payment intent on the server side to then uh create a payment with the payment method that was selected by the user on the client now the way we do this is by creating a document in the payments collection in our firestore and in our cloud functions we can listen to new documents being created and we can then create a payment intent for that document so in our android client what we need to do is we need to create a document in the payments collection of the user of the customer and um when that document is created we then execute a cloud function and maybe shane where can you talk us through how we can add a document to the firestore sure first in order to using the file stores we need to obviously add the file stop android packages let's just do this so we are going to use the file style uh library um and in the main activities we are going to create a new document and listening to the creation of these particular documents what we are going to do is this here what we are doing is so this is what we're going to do uh in the front end to create a subtractions of the stripe customers um here we are finding the current user's document and add sub called payments into the current logged in user and we are going to add a new doc new documents on inside the payment connections and add a listener to these particular documents creations because this payment payment documents actually contains a payment it creates a payment intent this is how we um get the payment intent kind secrets from these particular documents so in these success listeners we'll be able to get the document reference and from the document reference we are going we will be able to listen to the stamp shop events uh if the snapshot exists we could get the document information from snapshot data this data will contain the the client secret created of this payment intent so once we get the client secret what all we need to do is to confirm the payments call strike confirm payments apis with the confirm payment confirmed in 10 parameters of this particular payment method ids as well as the client secret we get from this payment documents once we create these uh functions what we need to do is to hook up uh with with the buttons um since we have a button called uh pay button what we are going to do is to listening to the click events and call confirm payments with the selected payment methods so this will be the end results let's rerun the applications okay um apc.com okay let's create a new customer establisher payment sessions as we said we are going to add new payment method into this new customer um and once we select this this new payment methods we are going to create the new documents in the payment um connections sub-connections and these documents will contain the payment intent and client secret which we could confirm it with the selected payment methods so let's do that cool the payment is down what we can do is go to our dashboard as you can see we create a customer xyz abc.com and we are able to confirm um complete these payment methods with this particular payment method we have just added in our using our android sdk preview ui great so now we have our payment made so let's look at what happened on the server side here so xinghui created this user xyz abc.com let's copy the user id here and when we jump into our firestore we can see this user now has a payment sub collection and we can see there is a whole payment intent object in this firestore now as you saw on the client side the only information that sheng wei actually added was the amount and the currency and then our uh so here the amount and the currency and our uh cloud function has then created the payment intent um so let's have a look at how this worked so here we can listen to uh the oncreate trigger for the firestore document here we have a document path so that is for our stripe customers a specific user id the payment sub collection and then the the document id that was added and when a new document is added what we can do is from the snapshot we can get the data and um sheng wei uh specified the amount and the currency uh now in most use cases you probably will specify um a product um id or a price id uh rather than the amount on the client side and then validate that price id from your database in the back end for this demo we just wrote the amount and the currency on the client side and then what we do is we retrieve our customer id using the uh document and we can here uh navigate back from the snapshot to the parent document uh so step back in our path in our database path to get back to our customer id and then using the customer id we create a payment intent for the amount the currency and bound to this customer and then lastly what we do is we take our existing snapshot so the document that was created and we now overwrite it with the whole payment document that was created in stripe so now that is the payment document that then on the android client you um were listening to the update so the update of the cloud function uh writing in the whole payment object including the client secret here so the client secret is then what uh chanway read out on the android client to use to confirm the payment and uh finalize it there now after that here our status of the payment still says requires payment method so because we confirmed the payment on the client side our server side document here is now out of sync and so this is where the web book handler comes in so when the payment was successful stripe can tell us that the payment was successful and we have a function here to then update our payment record um when we get a web or candler so here we can see the um webhook events so we're handling all the payment intent events succeeded processing payment failed and cancelled to then update the payment status so this is a simple http function that can be triggered from stripe so we need to set this up as a webhook url in our project and once we've done that what we do is here we construct the event we verify the signature to make sure that this event actually came from stripe so this is where we use the webhook secret and then we check that we have an event that we want to handle and in that case we then update the payment record so let's have a look how we can set this up so we already have um this this webhook handler function deployed to our firebase project so if we go back to the functions here we can see this handle workbook events and this is the public url for the function so now we can go into our stripe project in the developer settings we have the webhook settings and we can add an endpoint to now point to our handle webhook function so we want a bunch of payment intent events here uh we want the succeeded event we want the processing event uh the processing is in the case of an asynchronous payment method that takes some time until it is succeeded so it will be in a processing state in the meantime uh until then it goes to either succeeded or failed and lastly we want uh the cancelled event as well so at that end point at the point where we at the endpoint um stripe generates a signing secret that we can then use to verify the webhook event and this is what we need to set up on our firebase project as well so let's set the webhook secret here and we want the webhook secret so now when you set a new secret on the project you need to redeploy the functions uh for the changes to take effect so let's do that i believe we can actually specify uh only a specific function to be redeployed so by providing the name here because only our handle webhook events function actually uses the webhook secret so that's the only function that we need to redeploy okay now our handle webpack events function is updated and deployed so now um changue is still locked in with our xyz.abc user so if we look at the database we can actually follow along when xingwei puts through a new payment so let's monitor the payments collection here so xiangwei if you create a new payment for the same customer internet so we can now see the payment has been updated from our cloud function uh it requires payment method and now what the web book handler has triggered and has updated it to succeed so now our synchronization is set up and we can check the webhooks events and we can see here we've handled the payment intent succeeded event which is what updated our firestore document to succeeded great so that's how you can set up native mobile payments with android and firebase cloud functions uh we'll be around for questions in the chat and also if you have uh feedback please uh in the description below there is a form that you can fill in and let us know what you'd like to learn next we are also going to do another episode with the same functions project but showing how to do uh the exact same thing with ios with the thermal keys and all of that so stay tuned for that xiang wei thanks so much for joining us today and running us through the android side of things thank you thank you nice meeting you guys see you next time bye bye bye you\", metadata={'source': 'nw7rOijQKo8', 'title': 'Firebase mobile payments: Android',

Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] these are surreal times businesses around the world are responding urgently and navigating uncharted territories so here at stripe our priority is to help you serve your customers and keep your payments infrastructure operating reliably we're working quickly to add features that will help you take action and so depending on your business it's possible that you're facing a growth in the number and types of disputes and as you become unable to provide goods or services and/or you're having to readjust to new pressures on your finances and your operations this is a reality and so dispute or you know a chargeback is when a cardholder questions your payment with the card issuer and the issuer creates a formal dispute which immediately reverses the payment and then the payment amount along with a separate dispute fee is levied by the card network and deducted directly from your balance and so to help our users submit the best possible responses stripe provides a guided process within the dashboard and this allows you to provide all the necessary text images documentation that you feel are appropriate and so today I want to walk through a bit of that process for responding to and automating the dispute process when we listen for certain webhooks and so the agenda for today is that we will quickly set up a very basic one-page store with checkout we're going to talk about the data collection for best practices for responding to disputes we're going to show how to submit evidence through the dashboard we're gonna pre-fill an unsubmitted dispute from the database when we receive a webhook and then we'll build just a super simple UI to allow some users maybe support agents or sort of like back-end operations folks to submit evidence for a dispute from an interface on your site rather than needing to log into the stripe dashboard to submit evidence all right so let's get started and jump right into the code today we're starting from a stripe sample that has a little bit more than the developer office hours boilerplate because we want checkout flow that we can modify and improve welcome back again you stripe developer office hours I'm CJ a villa a developer support engineer here at stripe let's took take a look at the code so I'm going to use stripe let's see this is the the sample we're going to install so I'm going to remove all the demo starter plate we're going to say stripe samples create and we're gonna use checkout one-time payments today we're going to use the client and server version of checkout with HTML and we're gonna use the node back-end so we're gonna be writing in JavaScript today so let's jump in here and look at the code and I'm also gonna fire this so I'm going to say npm install and i am going to also install a another dependency called ejs which is going to be for creating some templated views so npm install ejs and let's see okay and then after that I believe we can start the server and we should have an active application here so I'm gonna refresh the page and then when I click on buy we are redirected to checkout so I'm going to close that back up and you'll see that's a very simple version of checkout we're only collecting the zip code and then a little bit more information so I'm going to create a payment here with a card that will immediately create a dispute that way we can look at our dashboard and see the disputes that we need to respond to test for or something ok so we click pay and this is what would happen if a customer paid for this photo they purchased a photo and then they filed a dispute with their card issuer so if we go over to our stripe dashboard we can go directly to payments and then disputes to see all of our disputes that need a response and this is the one that we just created here at the very bottom it's open if we open that up we'll see that this payment needs a response and we can submit evidence directly through the dashboard ok so if we click on submit evidence we will walk through process of submitting of responding to the dispute so stripe kind of walks us through this in the dashboard it says I provided the customer with what did you what did you give them physical product maybe you gave them a digital product or an offline service and so each of these different online businesses that you might have are going to have different requirements or different recommended evidence that you might want to respond with so in this case we're sending a photo so we will select digital products and then it's asking for a product description and we have the customers name here their email their signature maybe and then we have a bit of the billing address because we did collect the billing address as part of check out or we collected at least the zip code we also have the customer's IP address we did not upload a receipt or any customer communication this might be emails or it could be instant messenger messages or some sort of like you know social media messaging the access information we didn't we don't have really any information about when they downloaded the photo and then any additional information that we can provide so this is the evidence that we need to build up and provide in order for us to respond to this dispute now it's possible that you can win a dispute or you can lose a dispute if you win the dispute then the the money will go back into your account if you lose a dispute the the money is you know stays in the customers account and the fee is the potential fee is levied directly on your account so what you have a couple of options here one option is to just simply accept the dispute here and we can just say like we we accept it we don't want to fight this and we agree that this we weren't able to actually provide the photo that they wanted to download for some reason so we could click accept if we did not want to provide any information most of the time though we did provide the digital goods and so we want to say you know what was the product description well we had a Pasha unique photo of you know the beach or something and we we already have the customer name and email prefilled because we went through the Striped checkout process and so checkout bye-bye check out we were able to sort of pre-populate some of the dispute information well notice that if we increase the fields required for checkout so if we require the full billing address for example then we will see more information here and one of the tips for you know fighting fraud and preventing disputes is to collect as much information as possible so that you have really good evidence as to what happened and what transpired when you interacted with this customer we don't really have a receipt or any customer communication but we might say you know the the user mentioned on social media that they love this photo and posted it with friends or something on April 2 so then we can submit our evidence or we can save it for later let's just go ahead and submit our evidence yes we're ready to submit and that's kind of how we might walk through the process in the dashboard now if your product description is always going to be the same and maybe you have the customer information maybe you're not going through the checkout 3 stripe checkout but instead you're collecting the customer name and email and you have those in your database you have their billing address in your database and you might have the customer IP address when they came through your checkout process you might also have receipts or other information that we can upload we want to provide that automatically as in an automated way as possible and so in terms of the information that we can prepare up front we have some text content that we can prepare ahead of time like things like product description your cancellation policy disclosure and refund policy disclosure this is how you know some text that says when you present the cancellation policy when you present the refund policy if we look back at our checkout sample we didn't actually present any cancellation or refund policy when we were going through a checkout so the very first thing we want to do is add some terms and conditions with a refund policy that is clear it outlines what we what we define is a refund policy obviously you'll want to work with some legal experts to make sure that that is instant that is correct and valid and will hold up legally a couple other things you can prepare ahead of time so you will also want to make a PDF version of the the refund policy cancellation policy and then maybe other kovat 19 related government business like shutdowns so there are some guidance there's some guidance in terms of responding to disputes that are related to this you know global pandemic and so what we can do is from the stripe dashboard we have some examples of how to gather evidence and respond specifically to kovat 19 related kovat 19 related disputes that are related to government regulations that have been put in place to order or prohibit certain activities and so there's that we have a support guide here that is specific to responding to in handling kovat 19 related disputes so you'll want to go through that that guide but one of the things that we can prepare ahead of time is a PDF with these government related shutdowns so I happen to have one of those here already so I have this letter from the state of Nevada that talks about this travel advisory that is preventing you know access to certain things within the state of Nevada and so this is something that you might include as an uncharacterrized file other things that we can automatically pull per transaction we might have the billing address the shipping address the shipping carrier the tracking code customers email address name so these are all kinds of things you can pull at transaction time so when we receive the webhook for charge dispute created we might be able to pull all this from our database and pre populate the dispute other things that we might need to prepare when we're submitting is receipts service documentation showing when we provided service we might also want to provide things like the customer signature and then some uncatted text just like some miscellaneous text that allows us to respond to the dispute so you'll notice that every time that you are responding to this dispute in the dashboard you have this additional information that you can provide which is a bunch of text and you can also upload a file so things that you might include here so some examples for different use cases so if you're a ride-sharing example you might share the history of this customer's rides for example like Ginny Rosen took the following X rides in the last three months before this disputed ride on you know April first they went from one to three main street 207 River you might also include like the you know the exact time stamps of when they were picked up and dropped off for a physical goods example you might say something like this order was shipped and received at the customer's address here's the confirmation code and here's the you know the tracking code and here's a link to the shipment site that shows that it was delivered for a digital goods example you might say something like you know the customer provided their email address so that they could the audio book they purchase could be sent to them you know they provided this this email address that we sent a link to and then we can tell from our access logs that they accessed it from this IP address at this exact time so this is kind of the information that you might want to provide it's important that you provide compelling information that sort of like does the best job possible proving that this was not a fraudulent purchase okay so this is how you use the dashboard to submit some evidence let's go talk about how we might oughta mate some of this data collection okay so coming back over here to our to our application the first change that we wanted to make again was to add some terms and conditions so let's add a new HTML file here called terms and we're going to use the same sort of styling as the index page so I'm just going to grab these two okay so our terms and conditions might look something like this terms and conditions and you might also want to like make sure that this is localized in different languages and things so we might have an h3 that says refund policy and I'm just gonna say you know consult legal advice to write this okay you might also have your cancellation policy here if you have a subscription-based business you want to write down you know what the policy is around canceling that subscription so that that is like very clear okay and then we're gonna go back to our index.html and what we want to do is modify the legal text so right now the legal text in this page is actually just showing the number of copies is max10 we want this to say like you know I agree to the terms and conditions or somesuch and that's actually done in this sample is done with a locale so we're just going to modify the English version today and say something like by purchasing you agree to terms which are terms and conditions okay and so then if we refresh this page now we have new legal text here by purchasing you agree to terms and conditions if we click on that there's no route so let's add a route to our new terms page so we're going to go to the server and we're going to add a new path here that is going to be a get path to terms and we are going to send file to this some file path will kind of just copy what we're doing here for the index page and now when we restart the server and refresh that page we should see our terms and conditions so now we have a refund policy and a cancellation policy obviously this would have more detail and more content when you write your own refund and cancellation policy but one of the important things when submitting your file is you want to follow some certain guidelines for these for the content that you're submitting as a file so let me see if I can pull these up yeah okay so formatting your documents and images to upload you want to make sure that your documents are a u.s. letter or a4 size in portrait orientation this is really important you want these documents to not use color highlighting but use bold text and call-outs and arrows if you're trying to draw attention to certain things you want to use a 12-point or larger font and so all these are important because you want to make the document as readable as possible and you have to kind of think of it in a way that or consider the document as something that you might want to fax to someone so it needs to be like a really really kind of like basic document and so the way that we want to present this is rather than just taking a screenshot that might not be perfectly the u.s. letter or a4 size we're actually just going to use the Print command in the browser so we were printing out the terms and conditions here and we have a refund policy that's super clear we can see you know like what page it's going to what date we took the the picture of the refund policy and we'll save this as a document directly into our our project here and we'll just call it terms PDF so now we have a a link to our terms and conditions we have a PDF of our terms and conditions so that is that is great so the next thing we want to do is automate this a little bit more by going down to our web hook handler so we already have a web book Handler set up as part of this project and currently all we're doing is logging out if the check out session is completed we're going to do something similar but we also want to handle now the charge dispute created event and we want to say the payment was disputed unfortunately and here what we want to do is we want to backfill the dispute so we're gonna pass in the data for the dispute that we received in the web hook Handler and then we're gonna use some of the data that's in our database and information that we know about the customer to backfill that dispute so we might say something like data object we'll pass in the dispute object so when we receive the webhook notification we're going to deserialize it and then we have this request out body that data or event data so this data object is going to be the dispute object and then I'll make this an async function so backfill dispute is something we're going to define now okay and it's going to look like this we're going to take in the dispute and we're going to return back the dispute also and we're going to say something like Const dispute is a weight striped disputes update and then we need to pass in the ID of the dispute as the first argument and then some options that we want to update the dispute with as the second argument now I'm gonna pass submit false here because I don't actually want to submit this dispute as my response yet I'm kind of just like pre-populating the dispute with as much information as possible and then I want to take some human action to maybe collect emails that were filed or collect some logs that happened and because I don't want to submit the dispute immediately I'm passing submit false so that I have I've kind of like prefilled as much of the dispute as I can automate it in an automated way and then I want to go back and add different files and different evidence so here I wanna pass an evidence object which will contain all of our like pre-canned information so for instance this is going to have our our text for the product description which is going to be just some constant so a unique one-of-a-kind digital photo from Pasha okay maybe that's our product description we're also going to have something like a refund disclosure you know we the refund policy is shown at checkout time or something in terms and conditions so this is going to be our product description and our refund let's see what that's that field is actually called here okay so I'm going to pull up the API reference the full API reference and then go to updated dispute and look at the evidence that we can submit here we have our refund policy disclosure so that's telling where we disclosed the the refund policy refund disclosure we also have our refund refusal explanation here we can say stuff like we don't off like no we don't offer refunds once the image is downloaded or something so we might have a standard refund explanation it's like once the image is downloaded we don't offer refunds okay alright so we have our refund refusal explanation other things that we might include here is our refund policy so our refund policy is going to be the ID of a file upload so when we're back filling this dispute evidence one thing we'll want to make sure we do is check to see if the dispute already has a refund policy attached and if it doesn't we want to upload a file that includes our refund policy and then use the ID of that uploaded file in the evidence that we're submitting so we want to say something like if DDOT evidence refund policy if there's no refund policy in the evidence for the existing dispute then we want to create a new file so we'll have another episode soon about how to upload files to stripe so I'm going to kind of like breeze through this a bit we want to just find the file that we want to upload here and that's going to be in let's see we're gonna go up and we're gonna call this terms PDF and then the file that we're passing in is going to be called terms dot PDF and we're submitting the purpose of this file is dispute evidence and once we have the file uploaded we want to save that on that the ID for that object on our evidence here so we're gonna say evidence dot refund policy is equal to upload ID so this ID is going to be something like file with a random string after it and that will represent the ID of the terms PDF that we just uploaded and once we attach it as evidence for this dispute we can't reuse that file so we're going to need to re-upload this each time you might have some process where you want to like sort of Auto generates the PDF documents or the documentation that's happening you can do that too just keep in mind that you want to keep 12-point font or a larger it should be something that you can fax you want to use bold text and sort of call-outs to point to important regions okay so we're going to upload that file and then we're going to submit this evidence and update and then we'll return the dispute at the end so this is kind of where we'll start with back filling the dispute we might also here want to say something like if we if we have a database of customers we might have good information about the customer that's not being pre-populated because if we're using stripe elements to collect payment or to tokenize and then we're using payment intents directly to charge the customer then we might not have all of this the customers name and email and IP address that might not be pre-populated because we're taking the payment we're using our own checkout page a lot of that was pre-populated because the checkout page will collect some of that for us and help us pre populate the dispute response so just want to show if we had some sort of database here of customers very simple billing address might be just the string like 1 2 3 Main Street Reno Nevada 8 9 4 3 6 we might have like the name Jenny Rosen we might have the email Jenny Rosen at example.com there's other information that we might have here the IP address that they purchased from we might have other information here let's see within the evidence that we need to submit we need the email address name Purchase IP in this case I don't really have a way to collect the signature of the customer but you might have a process where you're having something delivered and the customer needs to sign for it and you might have an image of the signature that was taken so we have the billing address you might have the access activity log so this might be some sort of string that says you know like April 1 2020 at you know 11:04 a.m. they you know accessed images / Pacha PDF or something art dot PNG this is the file maybe the file that we sold to them okay so you might have an access activity log all of this is very valuable information when filing a disputes if you don't already collect this you might want to start collecting it just in case you know as a hedge against the risk that someone will dispute a payment that may not be fraudulent okay there's also evidence here for handling duplicate charges and handling you know services when you're going to provide an in-person service you might have documentation showing that the service was provided maybe have been if you're like a window tinting service you have a picture of the work order or the the actual like tint job after it was completed shipping address carrier and the tracking number are really important when you're sending physical goods because we can use that to look up and see this was delivered to the shipping address of the customer on the date that you said that it was down here we have more around the uncatted Erised file and text so we're gonna submit these through the UI a little bit later but I want to just show kind of like backfilling so in this process where we're battling a dispute we might look up the customer in the database so this is going to be like with simulated of us looking up the customer in the DB and then we're going to pre-populate that's this evidence again so billing address is going to be customer dot billing address we are gonna say the customer name is customer name customer email address is customer email I believe that's what it's called customer email address yep customer purchase IP is going to be customer dot purchase IP excess activity log so especially for SAS products you'll likely want to track at least when customers are logging in and using your product to show that they actually did login and use your product okay so all this is useful when trying to you know provide compelling evidence that you did provide a service so we've got our our sort of backfill dispute method here let's go test this out and see if it's working so the first thing we want to do is go through our checkout flow so we'll refresh the page here maybe we need to restart our server let's restart this and let's also we're going to use the stripe CLI to set up a listener so stripe listen forward to localhost webhook okay so this is going to form a direct connection between stripe in my local machines so that when events happen on my stripe account they are forwarded to this local host for two for two webhook this avoids the need to set up any sort of in grok tunnel okay so now when we go through this process we've seen the terms and conditions and we're gonna fill out our card information here test five or six sure okay processing [Music] okay let's go look at the logs here and see what's going on so we received a charge dispute created and it looks like this failed FS is not defined okay so I forgot to require FS so that is going to not work as expected alright let's go see if this is working so we've got a fresh node server running we are forwarding our web hooks we're going to go back to our demo click buy and walk through the payment process here we'll say Jenny Rosen - at example.com because we're gonna pre fill this data again from our server when we receive this Web Book handler so we're going to use our dispute card test 10 and then we are collecting just the postal code when we click pay this should walk through the process calling our web hook handler when the charge dispute is created and then we should backfill that payment are the the dispute with the data that we received on our from our customer database so we see that in our server log the charge was disputed we see that we received the charge dispute created event and that is what's triggering our sort of like backfill process and then the very next event that we see is that the charge dispute was updated so we were we successfully updated the dispute with something from Hart database so we can go over and refresh the dashboard and reload these disputes and from here we'll see what data was pre-populated so if we drill into this most recent dispute we can see that we still need to respond to this because remember when we are back filling that dispute we're submitting or passing submit false so that we don't submit the evidence we really just want to pre-populate with more information now so if we click on submit evidence we'll see all of the data that was pre-populated so note that the billing address is more complete than what we collected from checkout because had that in our database we have the billing address the customer IP we Bri populated from our database the email address we populate from the database the product description is now prefilled if we go down even further we'll see that you know we have an access information we have the activity logs of when they access that specific page we also see that there we had a prior payment for that specific customer that is tied back to that email address that's if we were passing in a customer ID we can always tie back to all the different charges we also now have this refund information which includes the refund policy are the they're sort of like how we present our refund policy we have the PDF document that we uploaded that shows what the refund policy is so it's you know this document that is in at least twelve point font showing what the refund policy is we show the reason why we're refusing to refund once the image is downloaded we don't offer any refunds so all of this information is now pre-populated and if we wanted to we could then add some additional information here directly through the through the dashboard or if we wanted to we could build a simple UI to allow folks that don't have stripe dashboard access to submit evidence so let's go do that now we'll build just a very simple UI here that we can go to from just saying like disputes slash and then the idea of the dispute to pull up and a UI for that dispute if we want to find the ID of the dispute we can do that by looking at the event logs that happened here so we can see that you know a dispute was created or funds are withdrawn for each of the charge that dispute events that are firing on our on our account we can find the ID of the dispute so we'll just pull this one up as the ID of the dispute and we're gonna go to slash disputes slash and then the ID of the dispute so we're gonna go define this route on our server and then render some HTML that allows us to provide some additional information and if it is a co vid related thing maybe we'll upload the uncatted file for the government shutdown that is that is happening so let's go back to our server here and create a new client-side interface dispute HTML and this is going to be using maybe our like standard CSS for a dispute or for office hours dispute that ID so we're gonna pass in the dispute object then we're gonna have some fields one of them is going to be the uncatted eyes text so additional information and we'll just make this like uncatted or rised text and it won't have any value and then we need a button submit so we'll grab reference to that button when it's clicked we will send a request to our server to slash disputes slash and then the ID of the dispute against will have two routes one is it get route for this page and one is a put route to update the dispute so we'll make this a put route that takes in the body which is going to be the Uncategorized text and we'll need a reference to that and then let's also add a select box here that allows us to define like standard response reasons and we'll say you know this is a standard response and by default will not have a standard response and then we might also have a co vid one that's like Co vid and this is going to have the documentation around the government shutdown for Kovan so let's pass that also so we're gonna grab reference to that by ID and pass that here so standard is going to be standard value so we're passing two things to the back end we could collect a lot more here to completely submit the evidence as you can imagine we might add more fields for grabbing you know allowing a user to take a printout of email communication or a printout of some like facebook messenger Instagram messenger sort of like Twitter DM take an image of that create a PDF and upload those you can imagine all kinds of different UIs that you would build here for support folks to submit evidence to respond to a dispute for now we're just going to collect some uncatted text and a standard value that will allow us to upload that government PDF when we receiving disputes that are related to covin okay so now that we have this really really basic UI it has a button we've got our standard response let's just go see if we can add a route for this so we're gonna need a get route and it's gonna go to disputes slash ID we're gonna pull up the dispute actually we should be able to just submit it so again we're going to create our evidence here with our uncatted eyes text from the request body and in this case what we want to do is say if the dispute already has a uncatted eyes file or no so we want to we want to check the if the standard is co vid so if req body dot standard is Kovan then we want to just upload the kovat government PDF documentation as a file attach that to our evidence and then update our dispute with our evidence and then we'll just respond with the JSON of the dispute so if this is the case if the standard response that we are providing here is lady dacovia then we might say upload a file that is now going to be the guv PDF and this is again dispute evidence and we're gonna put this in uncatted Erised file okay and then we're going to update the dispute which we have the idea because request body or request our programs that ID is going to be the idea of the dispute because we passed that in from the client okay I'm actually mixing up this this is this should be the put the get is going to be just returning the file with the the content of the dispute and then we're gonna yeah we'll just return with the JSON for the dispute here okay we want to pass the evidence and submit true this time okay so when we receive a put request to dispute /id this is going to be from the button click it's passing in the uncatted text that was filled in on the client if the select box was chosen for Co vid we're going to upload the government PDF regarding the travel restrictions we will store the file ID in the uncatted file as evidence and then we're going to update the dispute with this evidence and submit it so this is going to be us actually completely submitting the dispute evidence for review after which we'll need to wait for a response okay so then we need a way to actually get this page this one is going to be disputes ID and this one is going to look just like these I believe but in this case we actually do want to render dispute we're going to pull the dispute from the stripe API and return that in the HTML so that we're going to we're going to render dispute as ejs so that we can use JavaScript templating in the dispute client-side page and then we're going to render dispute passing in this dispute object so let's go see if this is working so we need to restart our server and then refresh this page and we should get back the HTML for the dispute that has this ID and if so we'll have that ID kind of just like embedded in the h1 tag it looks like we are failing no default engine was specified ah yes I need to actually set this up so that I can use ejs so app dot set view engine is ejs and then app dot set views are going to be at the same place as our client so process dot and we might need to resolve this now process that end dot static dur I believe that should work okay let's restart this refresh our page here view is not a constructor this should be called views okay you start refresh the page okay now we've got our sort of like admin interface for responding to disputes we can pick our standard response as kovat 19 and we might want to add some additional information like because of travel restrictions we were unable to provide this service for some reason okay well submit our evidence we didn't actually have any response here but we can go pull up this dispute in the dashboard and look at it here so if we pull up this dispute and it looks like it's not actually submitting what is going on here so we're sending our put request to the server and then on the server there's no such file okay let's see okay so I had the PDF but it was in the wrong directory so node server start this back up come back over here refresh the page pick Cova 19 test clear this out we're gonna submit our evidence okay we're making a call to the server and the server is listening on port 4 - 4 - we did get a response that is the dispute object let's go back to our dashboard here and refresh for this dispute you should go from needs response to disputed as it did because we are officially submitting the evidence ok so now that we have submitted all of our evidence if we wanted to we can see the evidence that was updated by looking at the logs so we can see a post request here where we're passing the test content and we also have the file that we uploaded and we're passing submit true so this is submitting the evidence for the dispute yeah so I think we're looking good for automate automating backfilling the dispute object we're looking good for building a UI that allows users to submit evidence from our own page we're looking good for automating sort of the submission of standard PDF files now there's a bit more advanced subject around generating those automatically hopefully your disputes aren't so high that you that that is required for the automation hopefully this is like a very rare instance for you obviously the very first thing you want to do as soon as you receive a dispute is to reach out to your customer and talk directly to your customer work with them try to clear up any misunderstanding so talking directly to the customer is often the best way to resolve a dispute because if it is a misunderstanding the customer can withdraw the dispute from the issuer's so they can go to the issuer and say this was actually made an error I didn't recognize the statement descriptor that was on my on my statement and I you know I contested this but this is like actually a legitimate charge so that's the very first thing is you always want to go and talk directly to the customer couple things to mention about connect so for when you're using stripe Connect as a platform so think lift or Shopify it's possible for you to create a destination charge this means that the the charge happens on the platform and then you transfer a little bit of the money to one of your connected accounts so the platform in this case handles the liability for refunds and charge backs so when the customer disputes the charge stripes gonna pull the funds from the platform and this means that stripe is gonna pull the entire charge amount back but we're also going to pull the dispute fee from the platforms balance so the platform can recover that charge amount from the connected account by reversing the corresponding transfer this is gonna work even if the connected account doesn't have enough funds by bringing their balance negative and so we plan to have another episode about dealing with these negative balances and top-ups but I want to mention that for that dispute fee we sort of assume that you as the platform are owning the relationship with the connected account or I'm sorry with a customer and owing stripe for that amount so while there isn't really a built-in way to automatically pull that dispute fee from the connected accounts there's multiple approaches that you might take number one you might debit the connected account for the fee directly with the account debit feature to make sure but you want to make sure that you meet those requirements - you might withhold the fee on future charges by taking a larger application fee later or decreasing the amount sent to the connected account so for instance on the next one hundred dollar charge instead of sending $90 to the connected account and keeping ten for yourself you send 75 and keep twenty-five for yourself you know the usual depending on how much the dispute fee is another option is to collect the credit card for your connected accounts and just charge them directly as if they were an normal customer for your platform and then finally is another option is just to create direct charges instead of destination charges that way the dispute always ends up living on the connected account so here's a couple options for connect related dispute and refund issues that you might run into when you are a connect platform again we hope that this was useful we understand this is a tumultuous time and that you might be somewhat discombobulated and disoriented and we really hope that we can provide some guidance here and helping you navigate this and helping you build your business in this really uncertain time so please reach out if you have any questions we'd be more than happy to help you on IRC we'd be more than happy to help you at

Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] in this episode we cover foundational topics and dig into the basics of Python and the flask web framework how they work together and how we use flask as a base for developer office hours episodes and also in our stripe samples which is a collection of github repositories demonstrating integrations with many different stripe products so you might be just getting started and are curious about how to build a web application from scratch to take your first online payment and so this episode will cover some basics to help you get started quickly with Python and flask so if you've already got a back-end set up and you're comfortable with like adding new routes and are looking to add a new stripe integration you might want to check out some of the other office hours episodes we have where we show how to integrate specific stripe products and features so why flask flask in its own words is a Python web framework built with a small core and easy to extend philosophy so this allows us to keep the code for a demo concise well also still showing a real working example so it might be helpful to watch and refer to a couple other videos before watching this episode so number one is the episode about managing environment variables with Python specifically the Python 10 package and the second being the introduction to the stripe CLI which really powerful command-line tool so as a quick agenda for today we're going to cover how to set up a client with a basic static HTML page and some stripe j/s installed then we'll install dependencies with pip we'll implement basic flask server adding some get routes and some post routes and finally we'll set up a super simple post route that you can use as your web hook handler all right let's jump in and take a look at what we might build today so if you wanted to kind of just jump through time and go to the end and see what we're gonna build one tool that you can use and you can also use this when we're going through office hours to install this base in this template is by using the stripe CLI you can say stripes samples list and that gives you the list of all the different stripe samples that you have access to today we're working with a developer office hours stripe sample which is actually a starter for all of the office hours that we're gonna do moving forward and it includes the boilerplate doesn't actually have the integration but it includes the boilerplate so you can install that by saying stripe samples create and then passing in the name of the stripe sample so developer office hours in this case and that'll allow you to pick which server you want to use in this case we're talking about Python and that creates a directory called developer office hours and this is what we're gonna implement today so we have a client directory and a server directory and in the client director we have just a really simple index.html page in the server directory we have a simple flask server pi so this is what we're gonna what we're gonna build today is just this starter so if you wanted to kind of jump to the end and just use that there you go otherwise follow along as we build this from scratch so I'm just gonna remove that directory and we're gonna start here with creating two directories client and server and then we're gonna first implement the client just a really basic client so client index.html this is a blank file and we're gonna start off with just adding some basic HTML so developer office hours might be the title drop in some CSS for structure and a couple of divs with a header tag here at the bottom we want to install stripe j/s so the way that you do that is by adding a script tag that points at the stripe j/s library so it looks just like this and you want to make sure that your script tag does not have defer or async in that it is polling directly from jst stripe comm so that you always have the the most up-to-date version of the stripe client the stripe GS clam now for developer office hours will often write the JavaScript related to a page directly in line so in an inline script tag for some of the stripe samples will include a JavaScript a JavaScript file that lives in the client directory that we refer to and pull in from the HTML client so we'll have a script tag with a source points to a javascript file in the project for office hours we're gonna do it in line just so we have everything on screen you can kind of see as we build so most often will initialize an instance of stripe and in this case I have hard-coded the publishable key but we want to change the way we're doing that and instead fetch the publishable key from the server so add a little to do that go fetch that publishable key from the server so this is kind of the baseline HTML that we'll start with and yeah let's go ahead over install some dependencies and get started on the server so I'm going to change directory into the server directory here and then I'm going to use Python - 3 - ahem then then to create a virtual environment here and I can say dot then slash bin slash activate to activate the virtual environment and then I want to use pip to install dependencies I'm gonna say pip install and in this case we need a handful of dependencies we're gonna use flask we're also going to use stripe and Python dot dot n to manage our environment variables again we have that other episode of managing environment variables if you're curious ok great so that's installing all of our dependencies the next thing I'm gonna do is copy in my dot N file which holds my striped keys ok so now that we are installed we can go implemented ah server dot pi ok so again this is going to start off as a blank file and the very first thing I want to do is just load our environment variables and make an API request to stripe just to make sure that things are working as expected so let's import stripe and let's also import OS that's going to be the package we use to access our environment variables and then nest next we're going to install all the dependencies that are that come from flask so say from flask import flask capital the the class flask we also want to use rendered template for sending back some HTML where else can you use JSON fi for sending back JSON in a response we want to use we want access to the request and that I think that should do it let's see and then the next thing we want to do is import the tools to load our environment variables so from dot n we want to import load end and find dot n okay and so the way that we load those environment variables is we simply say load dot n and we pass in find dot int and execute that ok so now we should be able to set our stripe API key so we're gonna initialize the stripe API key by saying stripe that API key equals OS get and and then we pass in stripe secret key that installs or that just sets the API key on stripe so that we can make authenticated API requests and then the next we want to do is just test this out so let's see if our if our secret key was initialized correctly and if week if we can receive some plans back maybe from our account that will tell us if we're using the right API key so now we want to try something like maybe just print stripe dot pland list and that should fetch our plans if we have any defined in our account if we don't have any we should still see some JSON with like an empty array for the plans that would have returned so let's head over to our server directory and say Python server and we do we get back some JSON with our plans so that is working as expected that's totally great cool so let's go add a get route that should just return so we're gonna we're gonna start working with flask now we'll install a simple get route for the route route that we want to eventually return our HTML directly from the index.html page that we defined before so let's start really simply and add a method here and we'll call it index and we want index to just return hello stripes kind of like the hello world here of flat and now the way that we tell this method that it is a route is by using this app dot route decorator so we say at after out and we pass in some config options about the route in this case because it's a get request and it's very default we can just pass the string for the path that we want this method to return the result for so we say app dot route slash and that defines a route so when a request comes into our server for the route route it will execute this index function and return the string hello stripe Dib so that's what we should see when we make a request that should be there is the the body of the response that we get and then finally here at the bottom we need to start up the app and actually run it so we say app dot dot run and we pass in port 4 - 4 - and I'm remembering here that I didn't actually initialize an instance of app so we need to do that also so the way that we can initialize an instance of app is we say app equals flask so we call this like we are kind of like constructing an instance of flask here and we pass in underscore underscore name and that is the name of the current file followed by static folder and our static folder is a sibling of the server directory so the directory were in now is service we want to go up one and over to client that's gonna be our static folder we also want to pass in static URL path which is just the empty string and then we also want to define the template folder so that we can use this render template method so we say template folder is the same thing as the static folder so dot dot slash client and that should initialize an instance of app for us ok let's just go test and see if this is working as expected so we want to go back to our server directory here and say Python server that should start an instance of a flask so now we're we're serving the flask ask app called server which was the name of the the file here and then we can use a command line tool called curl to make an HTTP request to our local running server curl is a command lined HTTP clients very simple so we can say curl localhost for two for two and this will make a get request to our server so let's just see if that worked ok so the output of curl we get back hello stripe devs just as expected and in our server logs we can see that there was a get request made for slash HTTP 1.1 and we responded with a 200 ok and here is that response great let's push it one step further and see if we can get this to return some HTML so rather than just returning the string hello stripe devs instead we want to also say you know render template we want to tell it the name of the template in this case index.html okay so with that simple change we'll restart the server and see if we can get that HTML back and we did so that looks great and now we can actually click on this link and open up localhost 4 - 4 - and we see that's the HTML that we wrote so that is working great next step let's add another get route to our server that will respond with the publishable key that is stored in the environment variables and we can use that to make a request from our client to fetch the publishable key and set that and this also demonstrates how you might make other get requests to your server using javascript alright so we want to go back to the server we want to add another get route this time we need to pass a new and different path name so this is the the path in the URL that the request is going to match in this case we want to say maybe something like public key maybe public keys and we'll make the method called public underscore keys this is a pretty common convention and what we want to do is return in this case we're returning JSON so we want to say JSON Fi and then we're gonna pass in an object here that has key and the value of the key which is in our environment variable so we can say oh s get and stripe publish key I think public key will work ok great so within a get route you can receive some arguments usually as query string parameters but you can also maybe you might have like some arguments in the path this is a very simple example where we're just returning something that was in the environment variables you might also you know access something in your database and return some JSON or you might make a get request to some API to fetch something and then return that as part of JSON so this is just how you make a very simple get route on your server and in this case we're just returning an environment variable let's go restart our server test this out so if we say curl local host for two for two slash public keys that'll make a get route to our public keys endpoint and we do indeed get back this key with publishable key and that looks great that looks just as if we expect so now let's go use this new route on our client so if we go back to our index dot HTML page and rather than setting the publishable key this way we want to instead make a call to our server public keys ok so I'm using a an HTTP client that is just vanilla JavaScript it comes bundled with browsers it's called fetch and like most HTTP clients you can pass in a couple of configuration values and variables that allow you to configure the request and then you can work with the response that you get back a synchronously so in this case because we're making a simple get request we just pass in the string value for the path that we want to make a request to from the client so we say fetch public keys and this returns a promise that resolves with this response object that itself has a JSON method that returns in another promise that when resolved resolves with this data object which has the JSON for the response that we returned so in this case we want to set stripe equal to again we're gonna use that stripe constructor function and pass in data key to initialize a new instance of stripe and so this way we are storing our publishable key in an environment variable fetching it on the client when we initialize that way we can change between environments really easily so we're just modifying environment variables on the server rather than passing in or like hard coding the the publishable key on the client so it's a little bit better practice especially when using mobile clients so if you're on iOS or and you definitely want to fetch your publishable keys from the server just so that you can have a lot more control over if you need to roll a public a public key for some some reason so all right so now we have made this fetch let's go see if it works so in the server we actually need to restart the server here and then we can go back to the browser and refresh this page but I wanted to show you you can access the chrome developer tools by right-clicking and going to inspect this is common across many browsers so you you will often have some sort of developer console with developer tools the chrome developer tools are very powerful we have when you first open it up I usually do use a command option I in the sort of the thumb smash I to open this you see a bunch of tabs across the top we're gonna use today we're going to use sources in the network tab but there's a lot of handy resources in the rest of these tabs that I would highly recommend becoming well accustomed with so in the sources tab if we find the index page that we just loaded and we can scroll down and you can use the JavaScript debugger by clicking on a line number in the gutter here and then refreshing the page and that will break execution of your code at that point so that you can inspect values and variables so here we want we can hover over strike and we see that it's currently undefined because we're about to execute this fetch function now you can use these these buttons on the right to step through as you're executing so once you're confident that your code is reaching a certain point you can remove the breakpoint and click play that resumes execution note that the fetch command here is making a network request to 127 to 0 to 0 to 1 so our port 4 to 4 to slash public keys and they're the data that we got back is indeed this data here which we can hover over and kind of like inspect we see that it did return a key it is this PK test it's our publishable key so that is great we can remove that breakpoint and click play I also want to show the network tab so if you go to the network tab here and we scroll down we can see our this request for public keys and we also see that it was a 200 ok if go to the preview you can see the data that was returned pretty handy if this was a post request here at the bottom you would see the payload for the post body that's being sent from the browser I think we're looking good that is working as expected let's head over to the server to add a new route that receives post requests and then we'll add a button here on the client to just send a simple a simple post request back to our browser or I'm sorry back to it back to the server okay so back to our server file we want to add a new route that receives post requests so it's very similar to a get request here we say app dot route and then we pass in the path that we want to receive post request to my route we'll just call it something simple and then in the case that you want to support post requests you can pass this second argument to app dot the app dot route decorator here where we say methods equals and then a list of HTTP methods we want to support with this specific route so we're gonna say post so that we can receive post requests so we'll call it my underscore route and inside of this route what we want to do is initially we'll just respond by echoing back the data that we received and what kind of like nested under nested under a key so that we can kind of just get and get a sense for what's happening within this function so we might say something like we turn JSON of Phi our request which is going to be request JSON and so this allows us to respond and we'll just kind of like echo back the data that we received now a couple of things to note inside of your post route this is where you're typically going to be adding things to the database making API calls creating some resources so you might be creating a payment or creating the customer or taking some action like you know creating a like or a comment so that this is the way that you can think of this is the post route is handling all of the data that might be collected up by a form or by a button click it's receiving all of those checkboxes and radio buttons that you've selected maybe files they've uploaded and it's receiving all of that data and making decisions about that and creating a resource ok so a pull trout is the thing that handles when data is being sent to your server a big big chunk of data okay so this for now let's also just print out like request JSON test so we'll test this out by passing in some test value and maybe we can say like print this is test okay all right so now we have a new route first let's test it with curl so we start our server and we can use curl with a with - X so curl - capital X post this allows us to pass in the HTTP method that we want to use so we want to make a post request to localhost four - four - my route and we want to pass in some data so the data that we're gonna pass in can can be a JavaScript object so we can use - D and we want to in single quotes we'll pass our JavaScript object here test is one two three and we also wanted to tell the server that we're passing JSON so we now can say - H content type is application JSON okay we received in error that's great we we failed here and so in our server log we see the error we see that when we tried to execute curl we got back a 500 internal server error all right so let's go investigate so if we read the error response here error in App exception on my route alright let's go to the very bottom name error name ryu 'xs is not defined so I spelled request wrong in our route so let's go fix that so this is this should be request ok restart the server and let's execute that same curl command and all right great so this is test we get the value one two three we passed in one two three let's just for fun let's change this to one two three lots of zeros so we get that value there in the server also and we are the response is echoing back this is our request and that's kind of got the body there so it's how we can pass in data with a post request from curl let's go see how we can do it from the client so if we jump back over here and go back to our our HTTP client let's add a button here that just has ID BTN and we'll say click me ok so this is how we can add a post request to our client so the first thing we want to do is grab reference to the button and then add a click handler so that when the button is clicked we execute something and then in the body of the click handler we'll make a post request back to our new my route and we'll pass back some just some fake data so we want to grab reference to the button and we can do that by using this document dot get element by ID because we set the ID attribute on the the HTML button that grabs reference to the button so we can interact with it with JavaScript we want to add a click handler so that looks like this we call BTN add event listener we pass in the name of the event we want to listen for in this case click and then we pass a callback function as the second argument to add event listener and this callback function is what is invoked when that event happens in this case and the callback is passed the actual event object which has a method prevent default which you can you can call so that the event that is executing doesn't bubble up so in this case if you have a button that's inside of a form and you don't prevent default then when the button is clicked that click event will bubble up to the form and the form will execute a submit event which oftentimes will cause a full page redirect so most commonly I'm making calls back to the server with Ajax and using JavaScript so I almost always prevent default here so I'm preventing default I'm going to make it now a call back to the server making a post request again with fetch so the first argument here is my route that's the path that we want to make the request to and the second argument is this option object that takes in method which you can pass as the the method that we want to make or the the type of HTTP request where you're making it as a post you can also pass in headers again we want to set the content type to application JSON so the server knows the data it's receiving is JSON it knows to like sort of parse that out as JSON and then we want to pass in the body which is the string string if I had JSON objects in this case we'll pass tests again maybe we'll say you know ABC one two three we could also pass a customer like cuss xxx we might also pass a payment method so maybe we tokenize the payment with the stripe j/s or something I want to pass that back to our server we can say p.m. card visa which is one of our test cards I also wanted to show that you can you can send nested data this way too so you might have an address that itself has a line 1 you know Main Street or something and this could you know be further nested like type I don't know you might you might go even deeper with your nesting of the object that you're passing back to the server and that's totally supported and totally works the this fetch again the same way that it works with a get request when you make a post request it resolves with a promise that you can use this JSON method to return the JSON object that was returned in the response in this case we'll just console.log that data again all right so now that we've implemented our client let's go restart our server and go back to the browser and test this in the browser so refresh the page we now have a big beautiful click Me button if I clear the network tabs you can click on this no smoking sign to clear the network tab and then if you click on the click Me button we see a network request was fired off if we click on it we see that it was a post request to my route if we scroll to the bottom here we can also see all the headers that were sent if we scroll to the bottom we see the payload the request payload so this was the post body that we sent looks all well-formed and then if we go to the preview tab we see the response that came back from the server so we see the response comes in with that request key that we added it includes the address customer payment method and this test value that we sent and we did console.log that here to the console again if we wanted to we could use the sources tab to set some breakpoints and see okay if I put a breakpoint right inside the callback function for clique if I click on the click button then it breaks right there and I can sort of step through what's happening so that's super handy all right I'm just gonna play through and I believe that looks good we can go check our server log to see that we did receive the this test value we did abc123 so everything is looking really good for our post so that's how you can add a get route and a post route and how you might interact with the values that came back so again you know in your in your post in your post route handler you might do something with the data that's coming back here so request a JSON test or request a JSON customer to set the value of the customer or the payment method or what have you alright let's move on to the final step of our integration for today which is adding a post route to handle a web hook event so similar to this it's going to be a a route that receives methods of type post and the path will call it web hook all right so our web hook handler is going to be very simple today we have a separate episode about working with web hooks you can go check that out for more details there's a ways that you can verify the signature you typically do not want to have authentication on the web hook instead you use signature verification where stripe is passing a special header that you can match against a web hook secret again go check out the web hook episode we're not going to handle any of that today but I wanted to just like take a step back and talk about web hooks in general so a web hook is a way for you to tell a third party where to send post requests when events happen so in this case when events happen on your stripe account for instance an invoice is created or a customer's created or a payment is successful you can take action so I want to show you really quickly in the stripe documentation we have there is a massive list of event types here so if you go to stripe comm slash dock slash API slash event slash types there's a massive of all the different event types that you might receive so charged at dispute funds withdrawn one of the most common is invoiced I've created this allows you to take action every time a subscription is renewing before the before it's finalized you have a invoice payment failed if you want to send it some sort of email to the customer there's a huge number of different web hook event types that you might receive so payout failed and so today what we're gonna do is just show a very simple example of how to implement like the most basic web hook endpoint handler here another thing I want to mention is that users never see this web hook endpoint they never interact with it the only time that you're going to receive requests on the web hook end point is when stripe is sending you some data about something that happened this is all asynchronous the customer never ever views this page this there's no redirect that happens inside of a web hook in fact if you redirect it's considered sort of an error you must respond with a 200 response to stripe in your web handler so the web hook is really just a way for you to automate different parts and application logic that depends on when events happen on stripe alright so all that said let's get started here so we want to add in a new event so we say event equals striped uh event construct from and we pass in the first argument is the the JSON data that we received so here we're gonna say request that JSON the second argument is our stripe key so OS get in again stripe secret key and that will construct an event object an event object has a type so we can say maybe if the event dot type is payment intent created then we want to print payment intent was created now you might take another action here you might this this is where you might fulfill some sort of order the event type or so the event is a sort of generic object that has a type and it has a couple other attributes but one of the is that it has this object this data object and that is going to be of the shape of a real object in the Striped api so in this case for payment intent created the type of the object we're getting back is a payment intent so we can say maybe here we can say payment intent equals event data object okay we might also handle other event types so if event type is checkout session dot completed in that case the event type is going to be a or the event data object is going to be of type check out session so in this case we can say maybe like the session is event data object okay and then we can print you know check out check out session completed okay in both of these cases let's also log the ID of the object so we can say payment intent ID and for checkout session we'll say check out session the ID we can also print things like the status of the payment and payment intent dot status okay so you have access to the full object there which is very handy and allows you to automate a ton of things based on events that are firing in your account so if you want to add support for a new event type you just add a new if statement here that handles that that type of event finally we do want to return something valid so we want to return here JSON Fi just like maybe message is success and this is the response that's being sent back to stripe and you'll be able to see this in your stripe dashboard okay let's go test and see if this is working as expected we're going to use the stripe CLI to run some basic tests so we want to restart our server and then we can use stripe listen forward to localhost four - four - slash webhook so the stripe listen command creates a direct connection from stripe to your local machine and allows you to forward the requests that are coming from stripe the post requests that are coming from stripe to this local web book handler this allows you to sort of avoid needing the use of a tunnel or publishing your code to some public URL while while still testing your webhook endpoints very powerful we go into much more detail in the stripe CLI episode so if you wanted to you can check that out the next thing I want to show you is that we can use the stripe trigger command to cause an event type to happen so payment intent created so we say stripe trigger we pass in the event type that we want to fire and under the hood stripe CLI is going to build up and make an API request that results in this type of event so for payment and creates a simple request we fire off a payment we fire off a request to create a payment intent and this payment intent created event fires and we see in our server log that payment intent was created we see the ID here for the payment intent and the status there's no space there but statuses requires payment method that's totally expected and so that looks like it's working great let's also trigger checkout session completed so for a checkout session to complete there's a few other things that need to happen so it needs to you know create a payment page create a payment method create a customer there's charges that are successful payment intents that are successful so we're seeing a whole bunch of different requests come through we saw this checkout session completed event fire and we actually got back a 500 HTTP status code from our server so in this case it looks like we have another error so we have we have this call or I guess we go straight to the bottom of the error message here we say name error name checkout underscore session is not defined I think I called it session so let's go see if we can fix that yeah so here event outdated object I stored it in a variable called session and then I tried to access it with checkout underscore session so ID I don't need that first part of the name so let's go restart the server and try this again so checkout session completed we can see all of the requests are being built up to result in a checkout session completed event we say the payment intent was created and the other HTTP requests are coming through all with to hundreds we are expecting this checkout session completed to fire and there's the the ID of the checkout session there at the end so that is all looking good and that is really the baseline for for the boilerplate in the starter for working with stripe Python and with flask for for office hours so that that completes the content for today's episode really thank you for for listening and for sticking around we I hope that was super useful we have thick skin so if you have feedback for us please let us know in the feedback form below remember that we you are you're not alone when you're building your integration we're here with you we want to help you build your business so if you have any questions at all as you're going through and building this out feel free to jump on IRC with us we're in the freenode channel called stripe otherwise you can head up support that stripe comm with any other questions yeah again please let us know if you found this useful and we'll see you in other office hours episodes Cheers you\", metadata={'source': '7Ul1vfmsDck', 'title': 'Python Flask

Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] hello and welcome to developer office errors my name's Matthew Ling I'm a developer support engineer here at stripe today's episode is a second in a series of getting started with clarinha as a payment method and if you haven't watched the first episode I do recommend it it's only 15 minutes and it does bag presents some fundamentals about getting started with the client and we're going to be building on those today in this integration in these on priests and at the times you may want to offer your customers an alternative to paying upfront for your goods and services and client it does enable that by allowing your customers to choose to pay overtime in installments or indeed to pay later now the interesting thing about that is that you as the merchant receive all of the funds immediately and climb to does all of the heavy lifting to collect the funds from your customers so let's jump straight into a demo to see how that might look okay so as we were in the first episode we're still selling some t-shirts but instead of - redirecting directly over to Clara we will present the user the option to choose from paying immediately slicing in in two installments or to pay later so if I choose to slice it up in the German shop I can pay in six twelve or twenty four installments I'll just go ahead and choose 24 after some payment details these are test strings from Plata and submit you and we're done so the agenda for this integration is that we'll use the stripes UI to bootstrap a sample project from developer office hours we unpack the payment categories from the client source that will create and then we'll present those options to the user and so that they can choose how to pay the sample code for this integration is on github arm at stripe samples and as always they're stripe engineers here in chat and live online to field your questions or on IRC on freenode so if you have any questions please ask away ok so let's dive into some code okay so I'm just gonna cancel out of that and jump into a working directory mm-hmm okay so on the first part of the agenda or the first item on the agenda rather it was we are going to use the stripe see light - scuse me create a sample and a sample project so if I look at stripe samples list we can see a list of all the different types of projects that we can bootstrap using stripe CLI it's really a lot here and it's really really useful and whether it's getting started with subscriptions or accepting simple payments okay but we are going to create a sample using the developer office hours template and I am going to choose Ruby for us okay and then let's jump into the directory and it's given us two directories and clients on a server and with the index.html and the server Ruby and along with the jump file for specifying which gems we're going to be using okay cool so let's have a look at the code that we got for that and we have the stripe client library Sinatra and our emerging environment variables are pretty standard for our developer office hours demos and but what we also have is a route route on slash and a fairly fleshed out web hook endpoint which uses the web book secret and checks whether the event was genuinely sent from stripe by checking the signature scent in the header and there's another episode on both web hooks and stripes you lied by CJ and I highly recommend you you check those out too and okay cool so we're gonna try and reuse a lot of the code that we wrote in the first episode and so then we're not repeating ourselves so jump into the server directory I'm going to copy the views from the other client the first part demo so let's get everything that we had I'm dropping into the clients directory okay let's see did that work yeah cool cool so we have the products er B which listed our products and the success page for saying thank you to the customer mmm we're also going to take the server code that we wrote and so let's grab some code from the Barna Ruby file so we had an in-memory database of products the success roof the purchase route action action and which created the source and and we have the products action okay I'm going to take that much first I'm gonna paste it here got it indent that too mm-hmm and I'm also going to grab the charge creation so in the first episode we listened out for the source chargeable event so when the connoisseurs is chargeable as after the user has provided their payment details we listen for source charge Mon then we actually create that charge so we're gonna take at least this charge code here and I'll drop it here I think so we'll be listening it for that event type okay okay so we can fit we'll have to change this a little bit but we can fix it up later okay so let's run the server and see what we have okay so this is the route and so there's actually nothing there yet so let's go back to the server code and let's redirect redirect to products okay I'm gonna have to restart the server okay cool so now we're listing out the products in the products view um so we haven't made any changes to the purchase route so that will actually redirect us directly over to client to pain now so what we're gonna do is we're going to extract all the different types of payment method categories whether it's now later or in installments and we're gonna offer those to the user they can choose themselves ok cool so that's the purchase action so let's just so we're going to delete this so the payment methods categories um is part of the source that we created here so depending on the country that you are selling in so in this case in Germany there will be different types of method categories so it's it's useful to actually pull those eyes and then you can automatically show the applicable categories per country and so in Germany anyway a we grab the corner object and we ask for the pin method categories now I happen to know that's a string so we need to split the string up over the commas so now we have an array of payment method categories there so I'm gonna write the ER be render method first or code first so we're gonna we are going to render this and what we're gonna do is pass a set of local variables to that view so what will be in there okay we are going to pass the categories that we can loop over the categories and then generate those buttons that we saw in the demo so the key will be payment method categories will pass the array of categories and I'm also going to pass the the whole harder object M which contains the actual redirection URLs that we'll need okay cool and we don't have that view yet so let's copy that from the products so we're gonna need to copy the client products er B we're gonna call it let's just grab this yeah that's the same mmm yeah be cool and okay let's jump in there and make some edits okay so the products here be listed the product in the table so we're just gonna get rid of this and say maybe here choose a payment method yeah and we're gonna loop over the payments method categories category can't take yep and that loop there and I'm gonna cheat a little bit I get some padding by using a field set per button and what I'd like to do here is actually to generate the name for the button by looking into the Clara object and I happen to know we want to use a symbol here to to key into that hash and will interpolate the category oops category and this is the name so that's the that's the name of that attribute in the hash and we should actually have put it here oops name okay so let's start the server again and see what we have okay refresh that so we should now hit the payment method categories okay on to find local method variable or method - I've got a typo I've admitted something here so let's just go back to the server ah yes come on okay cool that should solve that problem now we should have three buttons with the three different payment method categories that apply to Germany okay now these are going to do nothing because I haven't actually pulled out the redirection URLs so let's let's jump back into the view mmm it's pretty much the same deal let's generate the URL based on the contents of the attributes in the car in a hash this is the redirect URL and we click yeah it's gonna be location address and we're gonna send the user to the URL so make sure have that right URL kind of how to redirect you on click location page ref okay cool great so let's refresh that page okay so let's click through so if I wanted to pay now that's perfect so I provide my banking details if I want to pay later great I can pay in 14 days or in 3 months or if I want to slice it into installments I can also do that too so before maybe completing this payment flow I'm gonna start the stripe CLI listening to events I'm going to forward them to our local server web book and we do need to pay a little bit of attention there so mmm so the event here is being verified against the signature and so once we get to here we know that we've got a legitimate event so based on the type so we call this a source the ax type we wanted to listen for his source chargeable mm-hmm okay I need to change this to euros since I am charging in euros in my German shop okay and that should be enough so I have to restart the server okay cool so let's see if that's worked we should see that the source becomes chargeable the the source is charged and that the charge succeeded and then we're going to check in the dashboard to see what happened okay so I obviously have given my tests and data details previously source becomes chargeable great so it posted to our web hook the web hook returned with a 200 ok which says to stripe great we receive the event everything's ok we created the charge and the charge succeeded so I jump in to the dashboard [Music] okay we're gonna go to here and that's the t-shirts okay and payments and there's the 1010 euros and April 8th yeah perfect all the times much up so that is my act in my charge or my current charge for this connoisseurs and we're done so that's another short and sweet integration with stripe using chlorine a-- and hopefully an indication of how simple it is to be able to offer your customers flexible payment options if you have any questions comments or feedback on this episode please do contact us on support dot Stratcom or on IRC on freenode and thank you so much for joining us looking forward to seeing you again and until then stay safe you you\", metadata={'source': 'tIEAs93ZW2Y',

payments infrastructure operating reliably businesses all around the world are responding quickly to these new circumstances and if you find yourself quickly needing to move your services online you can use the stripe dashboard to also move your payments online today we want to look at sending invoices from the stripe dashboard without writing any code with stripe billing we can send one of invoices from the stripe dashboard once we've created our account we can click through in the billing section to read the QuickStart guide today we want to create invoices and we can do this without writing any code right from the stripe dashboard first let's actually look at the settings for our invoices when we click through the stripe settings we can configure the invoice template we can set our branding in the branding settings we can specify our own logo and icons and also our brand color to make sure the customer recognizes the invoice as well as the payment page secondly we specify the business information so they have a support email address and phone number that they can reach out to if they need to we can specify the invoice numbering whether it should be numbered sequentially for each customer or across all customers on your account we can set a default memo as well as a default footer and we can specify the payment terms we can set that the payment is to you in 30 days or under the current circumstances we could extend it to 90 days we can include a stripe hosted payment page which customers can click through in the invoice to then pay the invoice online here we've enabled ACH bank transfers as well as credit and debit card payments but for customers in other regions we can also enable additional local payment methods now if we go back to billing we go to the invoices section and we can click to create a new invoice when we have a new account we need to create customer details let's send an invoice to Jenny Rosen here we need to add Jenny we can add in description as well as specify the billing information and if the customer is a business if we're sending a b2b invoice we can also specify a tax ID if we have that for the business in Europe for example some b2b invoices are v80 exempt so here we would want to specify the tax the tax ID for our customer now that we have the customer created we can add items to our invoice let's say we've done some web development work for Jenny and it's some smaller work so we're gonna build 500 US Dollars and now we can also apply a tax right we currently don't have any tax rate set so here we can quickly leave the invoice which will be saved as a draft and we can go over to the tax write section to add a tax rate we can select between different types depending which part of the world we're in in Europe we charge Li 80 and Australia GST for example and here in the US let's select say it's tax we can specify a region I believe the sales tax in California is 7.25% and it's exclusive so it is charged on top of the invoice and let's call it California say it's tax now we can go back to our invoices we can open our draft here we can set an item tax rate so if we were to sell digital items as well as physical items in one invoice we could set different tax rates per item but let's set a default tax rate here and add this to the invoice so we can see the tax sales tax amount that is added to the invoice and the total amount here and now we want to say we want to email the invoice to the customer so they can pay manually we want to extend this to say 90 days and now we can sent the invoice you can see see if Jenny has an accountant we can also specify their email address here and now we can send off this invoice when we send it off the draft will move to a finalized invoice and here are the details that are being sent via email to our customer they will receive a payment link that they can click through on the invoice to get to a stripe house--at payment page here they can pay it with their cart or an ACH bank transfer let's select cart we can use the test card details here and test mode and we can pay the invoice once the customer has paid the invoice they can download the receipt they will also receive the email receipt which you can specify in the billing settings but they can also download the invoice for their records so this generates an invoice PDF for them which they can keep if we go back to the stripe dashboard in the payment section we can now see the payment that the customer has made from the hosted invoice if we need to provide a refund to the customer we can also do this by issuing a credit note so here we can issue a credit note we can select the items that we want to credit back here in this case we credit back the whole invoice once we issue the credit note the customer will receive a refund as well as an email with the credit note with the stripe dashboard you can accept online payments in a matter of minutes by sending invoices to your customers I hope this can be useful to for you in the current situation we've also compiled a list of kovat 19 resources for all stripe users which is linked in the description below stay safe and healthy everyone and see you next time [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'YftvRXupgpw', 'title': 'Sending Invoices from the Stripe Dashboard', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 25302,

journey of implementing a stripe integration we want to arm you with a really powerful tool that will help you build test and manage your integration so enter the star of today's show the stripe CLI or the stripe command-line interface it's a command-line utility for securely testing your web hooks tailing your API request logs creating updating and retrieving API objects and much more that really just speeds up the common tasks and workflows so the content in today's episode acts as a foundational reference point to other developer office hours episodes and so whether you're just getting started or a seasoned stripe integrator this is going to be a great place to jump in welcome back to stripe developer office hours I'm CJ developer support engineer here at stripe and the stripe CLI has become an invaluable part of my workflow I'm really excited to share it with you so let's take a quick look at the agenda for today so to begin we'll install and connect the stripe CLI to our account and then we'll look at some of the API resource commands and pair those with another command line tool called JQ and next we'll explore the web hook commands that allow us to listen for web hook events and also trigger those event notifications and then we'll wrap with just a lightning round of the quick winds and other utilities that are currently available as part of the stripe CLI so the first thing I wanted to do is jump over to the wiki page for the stripes Eli's github and show you this this installation Docs this is where we're really going to start start going here or get going so for Mac you can use a homebrew to install for Linux you know for various distributions we have some installation instructions here and we also have a couple of ways you can install with Windows or as a docker image so since I'm on a Mac I'm gonna use this brew install command and I'm using I term today but really you can use any terminal that doesn't matter if you're on a Mac and you're really just sort of getting started you can use command space to open up the spotlight or Alfred finders and then type terminal or type I term to open up this window okay so I'm just gonna paste in the brew install command and this is going to install the stripe see alive this is going to be our command-line utility and as soon as the stripe CLI is installed there are some things that we can do so the very first thing I want to do is just try to type stripe and that'll show me all the commands that I'm that are available to run and kind of the way that we use the stripe command so the way that the way this works is we type stripe and then a space and then our command so some of the webhook commands listen and trigger we'll get to those later some stripe commands we can do log tailing and look at the status of stripe so maybe we want to just check the version of stripe CLI that's installed we can say stripe - V note that this one point 3.5 is the version of the stripe CLI that's not the version of your API so you'll want to look in the stripe dashboard for your API version which is usually looks like a date year-month-day separated by hyphens so the other thing we can do here now is we can say stripe status and that'll tell us the status of the API it shows us that all services are online that's great now the next thing on our list is to connect the stripe CLI to our stripe account so when we have access to a browser so in in this environment I can open a browser and successfully authenticate you can say stripe login so we say stripe login and hit enter it shows us a pairing code so reform favored prized right we want to confirm that that matches when we get when we open the browser so we're gonna hit enter to open the browser and then we are shown our pairing code and we can pick which account which of our stripe accounts that we want to use with this with this authentication of the stripe CLI and so I'm gonna say yep that pairing code looks right so I'm going to allow access and we're done so I can just close that tab and go back to the go back to the CLI I'm sorry back to the terminal one thing worth noting too is that you have to be logged into your stripe dashboard in your default browser before you hit open or otherwise you'll have to login for that to work which is totally another valid path ok so now that we've logged in we have access to all of our stripe data directly in the command line so we can say things like stripe plans list and that will list the plans for the stripe account that we just authenticated with so that's pretty cool the way that this works is there are some special keys that are stored in the config so we can look at stripe config dash dash list and that shows us the stripe keys that were created just for this specific setup so our default account is the one that we just authenticated - that's our like demo account what if you wanted to or maybe sometimes you'll have multiple stripe accounts maybe once for test once for production maybe have like a CI account so if you if you need to manage and kind of jump between those different accounts you can use the project name so we can say stripe login - - project project names CI for example to create another config so now we have a new pairing code we hit enter and then when we're we're prompted here we can select the other account so maybe this is the CI account that we want to authenticate with so glitz well that matches our our pairing code that we were just shown so we'll allow access and connect and so we're done here again and go back to the terminal and now if we were if we say stripe config - - list we'll see that we have both a default and a CI config it's pretty handy so if if you are in an environment where you don't have access to a browser and you can't pop that open for example if you're running this on like a CI machine or something that doesn't have access to a browser you can use the config set command so you can say stripe config - - set and then maybe you want to set your live mode API key to something like SK test xxx or SK live in this case and what that will do is just it'll set the key for you so you can go to your stripe dashboard grab some keys that you need to use for C and then use stripe config set as part of maybe your build process and that will that will set your key so we can look again stripe config list to list out our config and you'll see that this has been this has been updated cool so that's really how you get connected with the stripe CLI let's move on to part 2 API resources so you have full access to make API requests to your stripe account directly with the CLI so what I think might make sense is let's try to create a customer and then subscribe that customer to a plan all from the CLI so one thing you might want to know is like what are the resources that are available so we if we say stripe resources that will list out all the different resources that you can access pretty handy so we find customers in here that's great so we can say stripe customers what does that do okay well stripe customers takes an operation and here's the different operations that we can use create delete delete a discount list retrieve update and then some parameters okay cool so what if we say stripe customers create and maybe if we add the - - help flag that'll give us some more information about what we can pass so here in the request parameters these are just like some of the params that we can pass so if we say stripe customers create - - balance or - - coupon we can pass in arguments that are used to create that customer so another thing though that that I want to do is in order for a stripe customer to have like a payment method that's used when they are billed for stripe billing with a subscription they have to have like an invoice settings default payment method which isn't in the list of like default request parameters and so if I'm not if I'm not like a hundred percent sure what options are available to pass to that customer I can say stripe open API and that will open up the API Doc's for you know the AP the full api reference so then once I'm here I can search for customers and go to create customer and I see all the arguments that I can pass in to create a customer which is is pretty neat so we have the payment method that'll be important because we want to attach a payment method that we're going to use for billing and then down here under invoice settings we have the invoice settings default payment method so this is a nested argument so I want to show you both how to send those like top level requests args and then also some nested ones another thing to point out while we're here in the API ref is that stripe CLI is one of the like language options that you can use from the drop-down to see what the format of the request might look like so maybe for your integration if you're building in Ruby this is the code that you would use to create a customer with a description and with the stripe CLI it looks just like this so stripe customers create - - description and a description okay so let's head back over to the terminal and we'll say stripe customers create and we'll give this this customer and email and it'll be just like CLI test example comm and let's also give them a payment method which is p.m. Card Visa so this payment method right here is going to be the token of the payment method that you tokenized on the client with stripe GS or stripe iOS or stripe Android but when you're in test mode you can use these test tokens so one of what while you're looking at the test cards in the docs you'll see these four two four two numbers which are really common but then these in these other tabs you have options to use these shortcut tokens that are pre-built in order to test different scenarios for you so I'm just gonna use this p.m. card visa as sort of the the card that we're going to use on this customer so bypassing the payment method at the top level I'm attaching the payment method to the customer and then I also wanted to pass this nested invoice settings because it's nested you can't really use like the the - - argument for the request argh so we have to say - D and then I can say invoice settings default payment method like this because the default payment method is nested inside of the invoice settings argument so it's kind of like an attribute style the same way that you would see with curl or with like a query string parameter and I can again pass p.m. card visa so now this is actually going to create a customer through the API and we get back the data at the JSON data for that newly created customer we have this ID we have this customer ID which is great so the next thing we can do is we can say like stripe customers retrieve and then pass in that customer ID we get back the same data super handy so the next thing I want to do is create a subscription now that we have a customer they have payment methods they have a payment method set and they have their invoice settings default payment method set that's great so now we can say stripe subscriptions create and again if we do - - help that'll tell us all the different things that we can pass in when creating a subscription so tons of different options for creating subscriptions for now I just need customer and then I need to tell it like which plan to subscribe to so I'm gonna say stripe customer oops we lost our ID here let's go grab that customer ID and oops subscriptions stripe subscriptions create customer and then we also want to say dash D items so this is how we set the plan plan equals and then I have a I have a plan with the ID movies setup in here so I can say create a subscription for this new customer with the plan movies and look at that I've got a new active subscription I've charged the customer and it's successfully up and running and this is so cool I love that you can do everything directly from the command line it's so neat so now we have this latest invoice so we something we might do just grab that ID and say you know like stripe invoices retrieve and then pass in the invoice ID Justice a is the status of that invoice paid and it is so that's super handy way to kind of just like poke around and explore we've created a customer we subscribed them to a plan and so this is this is one of the examples that you can go through to like interact with those resources directly through the API with the stripe CLI so you can kind of think of the CLI as a command line interface in your dashboard as a graphical user interface that are really helpful when trying to determine what what things you're building for your integration ok the next thing I want to show is that not all of the API endpoints are accessible with your restricted keys that come with the CLI for instance if you have connected accounts so if you're a platform and you're debugging with connected accounts and you try to say something like stripe accounts list you'll receive this error that says the provided key arcade test blah blah blah does not have the required permission for this endpoint so in this case what I like to do is pass in my key explicitly with - - API key and then I store my my secret key which is not the restricted key but the secret key I stored in an environment variable because I'm doing this a lot but you could pass in your secret key right here directly and that would use your secret key instead of the restricted key and here we get all of the connected account data back so that's pretty neat ok so that's how you can pass sort of an API key if you're restricted key doesn't have enough permission ok the next thing I want to do is show you how to pair this with JQ so what is JQ j q is a command line tool sort of like said but for processing json directly in the command line very handy and because the output of a lot of these API resource operations is is JSON data we can interact with that json data directly with JQ so if we say something like stripe customers list maybe maybe our goal is to create like a CSV file of the stripe ID for a customer and their name and email for it for instance so if we say stripe customer list - JQ it's a whole bunch of methods that you can call with JQ and I'd point you to the documentation here so this is this is like the the docs for JQ really really powerful stuff highly recommend highly recommend it so if we take stripe customers list and we pipe it into JQ and we say dot or maybe keys that'll tell us what the keys are in the JSON object that was passed to JQ so there's data has more object and URL so in this case we want to look at data and we know that data is in in an array and we want to pull out the IDS of all the different customers so now we have you know just like a list of customer IDs that's pretty neat JQ you can also like pass JQ lists of or like these long expressions where you can compose different pieces together so we can say dot ID dot name email and then maybe we pipe that to at CSV as part of JQ to create a CSV file that has the stripe ID the name and the email of the customers directly in our account hey maybe we want a few more of those we can say - - limit 100 that's like the maximum so let's let's get the 100 customers here and you see their names and emails directly as a CSV really powerful stuff and pairing the stripe CLI with JQ definitely improves my workflow on the day to day so I wanted to wanted to share that and point that out okay I think that's that's the end of part two let's move on to Act three of today's show which is how to use the stripe CLI with web hooks so oftentimes when you are building a third party integration that uses web hooks you might set up some sort of tunneling software third party tunneling software so that you can provide a public URL to which third party can send post requests that you can then you know test your local webhook server so you want to tunnel from some public domain to your local machine to receive requests but that's like it's kind of tough to get everything all set up and configured so the stripe CLI makes this incredibly simple there is a command called listen and so you can say stripe listen and the stripe listen command is going to establish a direct connection from stripe to your computer and allow stripe to deliver webhook event notifications directly to your machine through through the stripe listen which is it's incredibly powerful and you avoid having to use any third-party tools in order to tunnel the requests from stripe to your to your local development machine now in production you'll have to go set up a real web hook Handler and test it out and test that your public domain is actually available and receiving these post requests from stripe but in development you can use stripe listen to have those events forwarded directly to your local machine now when you're using stripe listen with the stripe CLI you don't actually need to configure any web hook endpoint on in your stripe dashboard or with the API so by by saying stripe listen the CLI is going to configure a web hook endpoint for you inside the dashboard that will forward those those web hook events directly to your machine really cool really powerful stuff so yeah so this is how it works you can just say let's see stripe listen okay and so now stripe is listening for events to happen on our on our stripe account here you see the web hooks secret so if your web hook endpoint handler is doing signature authentic our signature verification you can use this web hook secret to verify those signatures and test your signature verification locally so right now it's just kind of like open waiting for some event to happen so the the first way we can trigger an event to happen or make it making it and it's just by creating some object in the API that will cause an event to happen also while we're here let me show you a bunch of different event types or the where to find the list of event types so if you head back over to the API refugee also do stripe open API and you go to types of events here there's a huge list account dot updated and then this massive massive list customer subscription pending update expired file created invoice that updated so these are all the event types the event types are usually this like dot delimited thing with the object type and then some action that's taken on it very long list so that's where you might find the different types of events so if we wanted to trigger an event one thing that we could do is just make the API call that will cause that event to be fired so if we want a customer dot created event to happen we might just say stripe customers create and that will create a customer and result in a customer dot created event happening and here's the event ID pretty cool sometimes it's difficult to set up all the different API requests you need in order to to trigger a specific event for instance the checkout session completed event is particularly difficult to - to trigger directly from the CLI to automate because there's a couple of different things that need to happen in there you have to have the customer has to go to checkout they have to attach their payment method a customer is created payment intent is created and then succeeded and then a charge succeed then finally the payment intent or the the checkout session completed event fires so in those cases where it's where it can be really difficult to to fire or to test triggering a specific event there are a handful that have already been pre implemented for you as part of the stripe CLI and that is exposed through the trigger command so we can say stripe a trigger and then pass trigger a list or I'm sorry pass trigger the event type that we want to fire so here in the supported events there's a big list and one that I want to show is checkout session completed so if we say stripe trigger checkout session completed event then a whole number of API requests are being made in order to result in this checkout session completed so we see a payment intent was created and then a payment intent is going to succeed will have a charge created and customer created a number of different things so here we have like a whole bunch of events that are firing just so that we can get that checkout session completed event to fire super handy so you kind of just say stripe trigger checkout session completed and then then you can you know you'll you'll see that event mm-hm be published to your your listener here okay one other thing that we can do is we can say stripe listen stripe listen - - events to pass specific event types that we want to listen for so maybe we want to fire up this listener but we don't want to receive all of the firehose of events that are happening on our account so maybe we really only want to listen to checkout session completed and payment intent succeeded or something so we can say stripe - - events and pass in the list of event types to filter down to just those event types that we want to listen to so I'm going to refire the checkout session completed event down here and we'll see that just those two events are displayed so we're kind just like filtering out which events we want to listen to so we get the payment intent succeeded and then we get the checkout session completed event and again these the events that we're listening to are coming from stripe so the stripe trigger command is making API requests to stripe that is creating the objects and when those objects are created and actions are taken the result in events that are being published and those notifications for the events are being published to our account and the account inside of stripe sees that we have a stripe CLI listen listener hooked up and so those event notifications are being delivered directly to our local machine really really cool really handy stuff now the one thing that we haven't done yet is passed this to a local but one more thing before we do that I wanted to show you if you if you add on the dash J this is kind of handy too you can you can output all of the JSON data for an event so if you have if you tack on dash J that'll print out a JSON for the incoming thing so by default also the stripe listen is going to receive events with the the API version which is the default API version of your account so they'll be formatted as the as the data for your your API or for your accounts default API version you can also pass dash L if you want the events in the latest version of the API but you can't specify like a specific API version just like your default accounts API version or the latest and that's that's it so here we get yeah like the in the in the log for our stripe listen we see the JSON output for the events that were published to our endpoint which is super cool super handy okay moving on so this is great we're having events delivered to our local machine but I I'm a web developer and I'm implementing a web hook Handler and I want to know what my web hook endpoint is doing so how can I use the stripe CLI to test my web hook handler so the way this works is we forward we can forward those events that are happening to a local web hook server so I have a web server here that I'm going to fire up and this is gonna be a look this is a local server it's a rail server it's listening on localhost 3000 and so when I say stripe listen I can forward to localhost 3000 slash web hooks this is like the local path to my local server that I want to have those web hooks the web hook notifications published too so we've got our our web hook listener let's again trigger checkout session completed and so we see the payment intent created happened and we got a 200 back from our local - our local webhook server if we go over here we can see in the server log that those post requests are coming in which is pretty neat so we got one post request and then we should get a flood of a bunch more as we receive those other events that happen and then finally we handle this checkout session completed event so that's pretty neat you can you can set up your local your local server with its web hook handler to listen for those events and then receive those a couple a couple other things to add about events and web hooks before we move on and that is these are the IDs of the events so EVT underscore that's the event that just fire this is this check out session check out session completed event and what you can do is one of the API resources that's that's available is the the events resource so we can say stripe events retrieve and we can pass in that event ID okay that's cool we got back all the all the data for that event that's great but let's say that for some reason we our web hook handler had a bug and it failed to process this specific event and what we really want to do is just reprocess the event what you can do is you can say stripe events resend with that specific ID for the event ID and when you hit enter it will retry that event and refire it to your server so that's that's really powerful super fun and something I really wanted to share ok so that that's how you use the stripe CLI to work with web hooks so there's still a couple more things that I wanted to show you trying to make it trying to make it quick okay so stripe serve is a tool for setting up quickly a local file server so let's say you have just like a basic HTML page just want to say like maybe we have like an h1 that says hi stripe integrators okay then we can we can say stripe serve and that will create a local static file server that you can then use to to test your local static files super handy there's a number of different ways you can set up static servers and and things but it just comes for free with stripe CLI which is so nice okay another really cool one that I wanted to share is stripe samples so you can say stripe samples and there's a couple commands here so a stripe sample is a github repository and a collection of code examples for that demonstrate how to integrate some of our products and so there's repositories up on github that you can explore and they generally come with a client directory and a server directory and the server's support generally many different languages so Ruby Python PHP go and so one thing that you can do with stripe samples is directly from the stripe CLI you can pull down a stripe sample and auto have it auto configure your your API keys this is so cool so we can say stripe samples list and this will tell us all the different stripe samples that are available right now so we can we can just go through here and say like oh we can learn how to accept basic card payment that's cool accept a card maybe this set up subscriptions one looks good so I'm gonna say stripe samples create and then pass in stripe samples create and then pass in the name of that stripe sample and that's gonna download and say what which server do you want to use like what is your back-end language Java anode Python Ruby I think I'm feeling like ruby is a good good option today so we have now this new set up subscriptions directory and in here I can just jump right into server and say Ruby server and yeah that fires up another local host for two for two and I can refresh the page and hey look at that I've already caught a stripe sample up and running in like two seconds so you can explore the code that is behind this - right like you can if we jump back over here you can say what does that server look like how is it implemented this is the Ruby code that's backing that server very cool stuff okay so that's stripe samples yeah as a quick recap we covered how to install and configure the CLI how to connect it to your stripe account and use the config command to set API keys if you're if you're using the CLI outside of an environment that has a browser we also showed you how to interact with API objects and create update finally we showed you stripe serve and some stripe samples a couple things we didn't cover that I think are worth mentioning if you just say stripe here and then start playing around with some of these commands completion will allow you to or it generates like the bash completion command so you may have seen I said stripe cuts are like see you and then I hit tab and that'll autocomplete to customers and then I can say re and that'll autocomplete to retrieve so bash completion will help you there it's pretty neat logs log tailing we didn't cover that so that's that's helpful for looking at the logs as they're as they're happening on your account the fixtures command this is like a really advanced version of trigger so you can implement your fixtures as JSON documents that can be a series of API requests that you want to make so you can kind of like build a custom trigger command that can automate a number of different API requests in sequence for you we talked about samples open is you know again to open those quick links in the docs and feedback is a great way for you to tell us what you think about the CLI how we can improve we're we're we're yeah what we're we might be able to to make make this this useful tool even more useful so those are a couple things we did not cover in depth I really hope this was this was useful for you and again this is really just a foundational tool something that's really important that I really want you to know is that you are not alone in building your integration we are here with you and right by your side and we'd be more than happy to help chat chat through any questions you have about your integration or best practices come come hang out with us on IRC we're in the freenode stripe channel otherwise if you wanted to reach out and get assistance for a non-technical question you can always reach out to support stripe comm that's a great Avenue yeah so until next time Cheers you\", metadata={'source': 'Psq5N5C-FGo', 'title': 'Introduction to the Stripe CLI', 'description':

Document(page_content=\"today we're excited to demo how creating cards through the API can be just as effortless as accepting them with stripe welcome back to stripe developer office hours I'm CJ developer support engineer and as a reminder we have knowledgeable stripes that are standing by in chat ready to answer your questions so ask away stripe issuing is an API for creating credit cards and it really is enabling new business models stripe issuing it's like it's an end-to-end platform for quickly like creating and distributing and managing virtual cards but also physical cards and these are allow you to do things like create like a employee expense cards with dynamic spending limits or generate virtual cards that your marketplace couriers can pay with their phones at specific merchants so you might create a virtual card and then use a push API to send that virtual card directly to your couriers phone and they can walk into a merchant and pay directly with that virtual card which is really really exciting and you know traditionally card issuance has involved tons of dev time and there's all these requirements and long-term contracts and lots of fees that are up front but with stripe issuing a lot of that complexity is abstracted away so you can start creating cards faster and scale more efficiently so stripe issuing right now is still us only and invite-only so if you wanted to get an invite head over to stripe issuing stripe calm slash issuing and then scroll to the bottom and you can fill out this form to request access to the beta this is really just kind of a fun end of end of the year episode where we wanted to show you how you might quickly get up and running to take payments I'm sorry to create cards with stripe issuing so today what we're going to do is we're going to use the API and we're going to build a quick rails app and we're going to create card holders and cards we're going to handle authorizations with a web hook Handler and then we're gonna list transactions and I'll show you what all of that looks like and so this is what kind of the final product will look like we'll have a list of card holders and right now this is just their IDs and you can click on a card holder and see like the just the raw JSON output of that card holder and you can see links to all the different cards so we'll say create card it'll generate another card for us and here's kind of just the ID of the card but we can drill in and we can see the virtual card number directly and we can see you know the expiration dates and the CBC's for those cards we can also see all the details about about the cards directly here in the JSON that's included so we see that it's a virtual card and then it's active and so this today and then we'll demonstrate you know that you can take this card number and go use it in a checkout process so that's what we're gonna build today and we're really excited to get started so let's head over to to the console here and jump right in so just completely remove that demo that we were watching just now and start completely fresh okay so rails new issuing demo I'm gonna skip tests and I'm gonna skip get and while this is firing up I'm gonna go grab my API key because I will need to enter that into my stripe credentials here so rails is still firing up all of its new front-end special front-end things and while that is going we will get started here so you can actually create cards and card holders directly through the dashboard we're not going to show that today because you know it's really just kind of like in the UI and you can you can easily do that what I wanted to show you is how exciting and how quick it is to set up issuing with just a few lines of code so the first thing I want to do is edit my credentials and I'm gonna enter the stripe key here the clipboard and then the next thing I'm going to do is update my gem file and that will install the stripe ruby gem which we're going to use to interact with the stripe API today okay and then for this demo I'm not actually going to save anything to the database at all we're just gonna directly use the API to fetch the data that we're going to display on the screen there's one other piece of what other change that you'll need to make in your dashboard before you are able to use issuing that is to switch to manual payouts so from your dashboard settings here I'll show you back in the browser yeah so from your dashboard settings you'll go into settings and then bank accounts and scheduling and select manual here the the next thing that you'll need to do is add some money to you or bank account I'm sorry to your stripe accountant so one way that you can do that in tests is to create a charge so I'm using the stripe CLI here and we'll add a link to that in in the description and you can kind of see this a little bit so I am using the stripe see all I'm saying striped charges create I'm passing the source let's see I'm passing the source token by pass if you pass the source toke bypass pending that will bypass the the the pending window where a charge is pending before it hits your balance so this when you create this charge it will immediately be available and your balance and you'll be able to use those funds for testing out stripe issuing by using those funds to spend money on issued cards so first thing they need to do is update your payouts to manual the second thing you need to do is add some funds to your balance by creating some charges with this toke bypass pending now in practice as charges are happening through maybe another form of business you're adding those those funds directly to your stripe account from money that you're collecting from customers then you can turn around and issue cards that can draw money from those balances so okay so we have we have created a big charge here with a thousand dollars USD and that is bypassing pending we'll just make a couple of those so we have plenty of funds here in our and our balance that we can use with our freshly issued issued cards okay so the next step that I want to do is I actually just want to generate a couple of controllers that we're going to use to show things on the page and then we'll update our routes so the first controller is going to be a card holders controller and that'll have the index the index page for card holders will just be kind of like the route route for the entire application we're just gonna show a list of the card holders that we have in our stripe account we also want to wait to create new card holders and to show card holders so I will create the card holders controller with each of those views so index new and show and then I will create another controller for cards and finally a controller for webhooks because we want to build a web hook handler that will be able to process incoming web hooks for authorization requests and those authorization requests will be either approved or declined in our web hook Handler I'm not sure where that is hanging sometimes for some reason spring causes issues so let's try that again rails generate controller card holders index and let's see okay there we go so that created the the three views that we're looking for okay the next controller will create is one four cards and this will just need a show for now I think and that should be good and finally we'll create a web hooks controller and that's just gonna have a create action so we have no view for it we're just gonna render back some JSON when we receive a post request from stripe and we have a whole episode about web hooks and so we'll link to it above and okay so let's see so I'm going to now jump into my routes and just define some of these so root is gonna go to card holders index and then I'm gonna have holders and resource cards web links the first one we're gonna work on is our card holders controller and in the index we're gonna create an instance variable called card holders that will have the list of card holders and we're gonna fetch those again directly from the API so here just gonna say stripe issuing card holder list okay and that should give us back a list of card holders and foreshow will say stripe issuing a card holder dot retrieve and so for the show route it's gonna look something like this it'll be like card holders slash and then we're gonna have the ID of the card holder here so I forget what that actually looks like so it's I CH and then a random string and this i CH is going to be the stripe ID the stripe token for the card holder so that'll be passed to us as params ID so we're just going to take that params ID and forward it on to the retrieve method of card holder and and get back the the card holder instance from the API that is exposed through the stripe Ruby Jim as in class a card called a cardholder class that we can access methods on so also with the cardholder show page I want to show the list of cards for that cardholder so I'm going to say at cards here I'm going to say card that lists and pass in cardholder and pass the ID of that card folder so we're going to get back in this case a list of all the cards that we have issued to that cardholder now okay I think we're getting pretty close we also want to make a create method here for creating a new card holder and before I go too far what I want to do is show you the stripe guide that I'm gonna follow here so if you got a straight comm slash Docs you'll find the issuing section of the docs on the left-hand nav and we're gonna go through the section called issuing cards and really there's just two steps creating the card holder and creating the card for that card holder so the step for creating the card holder here looks like this we're going to copy this code and paste it in our create action for creating a card holder you'll notice that it takes in email and phone number status and whether it's an individual or a business and then also the billing address that is really kind of like all you need the more information you pass the better because we're gonna run or stripe is going to run through some fraud checks against that that name just to make sure that you know we're following the regulatory and legal guidelines regarding issuing cards to card holders so the more information that you can collect the better as part of you know making sure that folks aren't making fraudulent purchases etc so again I'm just gonna copy that jump back over to the code here and paste that in so we're gonna create a card holder and the name that we're gonna receive is I'm actually gonna pass in first name and last name separately params email same with on the status is going to be active and the tyke is going to be an individual for this demo we're not going to demo how to build a business it's alright I'm sorry how to do it with a business it's very similar so that's that's where we're gonna start it's just with an individual that is active okay let's pass here and we'll take in the address as line one and then we'll take in the city as Lam's City and the state and postal code just like that in the country I'm actually gonna leave the country just as US because right now we're only issuing in the US so the create action is gonna or we're gonna build a form that will accept the name email phone and address of our cardholder and when that form is submitted we're going to make a post request to this card holders controller passing all this information in here to create a cardholder then we're simply going to redirect to cardholder ID we're gonna redirect to the show page before that cardholder when we're done creating that through the API obviously you won't you'll want to wrap this in some error handling and support other cases and collection and verification or like data validation on your own end but really just trying to keep the demo simple so this is how we're going to create a cardholder okay so before we go too far when we fire up our rails server and make sure that that is actually working here okay so let's bring up the browser and if I go to localhost 3000 I see no API key provided set your API key like like so you can generate the keys from striped web interface so I've already got my my API key in the credentials but you know what I forgot to put it in the in an initializer striped RB something to fire up a new initializer here stripe the API key is rails the application dot credentials dig I'm passing in stripe and then I'm passing in secret key all right a little visitor here for a second ok so now we've set the API key and I'm saying rails server so I'm going to fire up the real server and now I'm gonna refresh the page in the browser so that is refreshing okay card holders index that's what the index page looks like and that is what we expect to see okay so let's go back to our code I'm just going to drop in so CSS but things look nice this is from some CSS from previous demos and then we can head over to ok that's really just a to make it look nice here so all right so our list of card holders is going to look something like this we'll have a ul and we'll have an Li that's going to print out linked to our leader dot ID or an older path or an older ID and again that's going to be the stripe ID so for each cardholder we're gonna iterate over and print out these allies that have nuts in them and that's really going to be kind of the extent of our client so this is what it looks like we're hitting the stripe API and fetching our card holders and bringing those back so let's we can add a little bit more detail here we can say put out the ID but also print out maybe print out the C so now if we go back to our browser you'll see the name is there with it so we have just like a little bit more information ok let's also add a link to create a new card holder holders ad card okay fresh we have this ad cardholder link okay so now let's go build our form for creating a new card holder it's gonna be in card holders new so we're gonna have the name now we're gonna have a first name first and then I think we want like the address information so we'll say line one and city postal code okay we're gonna we're hard-coding the country but otherwise you you might accept the country there okay so let's go back to our browser and refresh and now we have this full input where we can populate this with information about our cardholder we'll call it now Jenny demo instead of Jenny frozen and then when we click create card holder that should send a post request to our server and it is now we're getting not a valid phone number that's because we did not put in a phone number there let's actually leave out the phone number completely okay for now because we're not actually validating the phone number we're gonna we're gonna remove that okay an initialized constant stripe issuing car whole er I misspelled card over there so pull back up the card holders controller here we're going to skip over phone number for now and this needs to be create cardholder fantastic so now we have a new ID card holder okay sorry that's let me show you what that looks like okay so Jenny demo to demo to create card holder and you'll notice that we have a new card holder ID here in the browser that we can use and that's going to be params ID for card holders show so now we can fetch the card holder or we've already fetched the card holder and now which one implement the show page here we're going to print out all the data of the cardholder list the cards and allow creating new cards so if we go to cardholder show and here actually inside of that tag we can print out the card holders name and down here I'm gonna make a pre tag it's just gonna hold the JSON the output of the cardholder that we received back just so that we can see kind of like the all the output of the cardholder and then I also want to show like the cards the list of cards here so I'm gonna say let's make another UL ID card path okay so let's see what that looks like over here and refresh card holder dot name for nill class so back to our code let's go back to our controller and make sure we are fetching the card holder as expected get back to the browser I had a misspelled the instance variable name there okay so now we see Jenny demo too and we see cards which is just a no there's actually no cards yet but there will be a list of cards here shortly as soon as we create a card so now I'm gonna add just like a big button here that says create card and we're gonna generate a brand new card for that card holder and that is the step two in this guide create a card so I'm gonna copy this for later and you'll notice that we're gonna create a virtual card but if you're gonna create a physical card you want to set the shipping address where the the physical card should be sent to so here we're gonna we're gonna create a card the other thing that we need to do too is eventually activate the cards you can you can set the card to active by default when you create it and that's not here included directly in this this demo snippet so instead you can it says when you create the card you can set the status to active so we're going to pass it status active so that our cards are active right off the bat just like our card holders so if we go back here let's go back to the code that is all looking good go to our cards controller make a new card and set the status to active and then we will redirect back and the thing that we want to pass here is the ID of the card holder so our cards controller is quite simple it has a create actions is going to receive the post request with the data including our our card holder that we're going to use to create this new card that we're gonna issue to that card holder and when we go to the card show page we want to show details about the card so we're gonna show you know the credit card number it's expiration and the CBC which we can retrieve from the API using the special details endpoint for the stripe issuing card API so that you can either call retrieve here with the card ID or you can call details when you call retrieve that retrieves all of the non sensitive details of the card so you can see last for the ID of the card expiration I'm actually not sure if you can see expiration but you can see last for things like that with details when you pass the ID of the card to details you're gonna get the full details of that virtual card so this is a little bit gonna be a little bit more careful when calling card details because you're getting back the real details of the car so this is this is really sensitive here on our show page we're gonna just like print the card all the card details so that we can use it as part of demoing through checkout but it's something that you want to take into consideration as you're implementing this I'm just gonna fetch the entire card and then the other thing I want to add here is the transactions so for each card that you issue every time that it's used there will be a new transaction that is logged for that card and those transactions you can fetch the list of those transactions associated with that card by passing the ID of the card to this stripe issuing transaction a API endpoint okay let's head over to our let's go back to our cardholder bill page and let's make a button here that will it's actually going to be a an entire form but it'll look just like the button to create card so we're gonna send a post request with a hidden input that has the cardholder so when we're on the cardholder show page that would just be a button that says create card and we're gonna create a virtual card that is already active and is assigned to that cardholder and then we'll see it added to the list of cards for that cardholder okay great so let's let's go back to the browser and see what this looks like so we head back over here we go back to her okay so we have this giant button now for creating a card so go click click create card and there it is so now we have we have a new card if we click on on that card we'll see the card show page for that we haven't implemented this yet but we'll dig in and show you how that should look okay so I'm gonna go back to our code and here under cards show when I wanted to demonstrate is showing the first thing I want to do is just show you that you can see the card number expiration in CBC and all that and we can just print it out and show that directly to the user here again sensitive information you want to be careful with this for demo purposes I'm going to show you that we can just put it on the page be easy to copy and paste and walk through the checkout flow okay so we want to do this yeah sure so we're gonna say card number and at card number let's see the expiration okay and then similar to the others we'll just put the the full free or the full JSON in a little pre here just so we can see the raw data of the card that is retrieved when you call details when you use the details endpoint from the API okay so I don't go to the browser refresh our page and here we see this is the brand-new card that was created it has this this card number in this expiration and the CBC this is a test card it's in live mode false but we do see that it is a real card so what I want to do now is I have a little check out a little check out implementation here that is using the same account the same demo account so I'm going to copy that card number I'm gonna walk through checkout to buy some pins with this card that we just created so I'm going to enter in that card number the expiration is 1122 the CBC is 1 2 3 test customer 8 9 4 3 6 whatever okay and then we're gonna click pay and right now there are no there's no authorization request webhook setup so the authorization request is going to run through the rules that we have set in our dashboard and right now I don't have any rules set up for issuing in my dashboard so we see this is Jenny demo 2 this is the card that we just issued to Jenny demo 2 then we're gonna attempt to use and there are no authorization control setup but we could we could add those if we wanted so you can just click Edit and then you can add specific categories that are allowed or you can add spending limits per category per month very very handy little controls that you can do directly from the dashboard and you'll notice that these categories are the MCC codes just like built directly into the - bored which is pretty nice so right now we don't have any restrictions so when I click pay because they don't have a web hook set up and I don't have any restrictions this should just go through successfully and it did ok so we saw that successful successfully process we'll go back to the dashboard here refresh the paid the page here for Jenny demo and you'll see at the bottom there is this transaction for nine dollars and our merchant is this demo merchant with that card that we just issued so that's pretty exciting let's head back over to our page and if we refresh this oh right okay so the next step that I wanted to do is add the list of transactions here below that line jump back over to our code and show ya so let's say actions sorry step back table TR the head is going to be ID you were gonna have the amount that was paid and then let's just show like the merchant okay and then merchant data is going to be where the name of the merchant lives so for each of the transactions and the list of transactions that we've just fetched from the API in our controller action we're going to print out those results here let's go back to the browser and refresh and see if that worked okay I said transactions actions okay cool and now we see that that one transaction there so that is super exciting we've already processed the payment and here we are you know just a few minutes in we have we're creating card holders we're creating virtual cards we're accepting payments with those virtual cards so really cool stuff already so that is that is the first step of our agenda we want to create card holders and create cards we've actually used our virtual card already to process a payment one other thing that I wanted to point out before we get too far is underneath the issuing docs if you go down to I believe it's managing cards where is it here issuing cards I want to make sure that oh yeah okay so under digital wallets we give you instructions for how to provision cards so you can create a virtual card through stripe issuing and then you can add it directly to Apple Wallet or to to Google pay and so we have some instructions here for how you might set that up very cool stuff essentially you can have a process where you're issuing virtual cards to your couriers sending that card directly to their phone they don't even see the card number and then they can use the card and cut you know go to the merchant pay for for some service that is maybe connected to your business in some way so the process is maybe you have like a food delivery service and you can have a driver or you know the courier sign up for your food delivery service and you can issue them a card that only works at the merchant where they are supposed to collect or to pick up the food that needs to be delivered and you can use the funds that the that the the person buying the food sent you directly through your strife account so it's really really exciting stuff so I wanted to talk just to point out that we have guides on how to use iOS in Android provisioning to push those card details directly to those digital wallets so that's pretty pretty handy and pretty exciting stuff okay so the next step in in the process here is I wanted to show you how we can build a web hook handler that will receive a post request when the card is is used and that post request will tell us some information about the authorization that's being requested and at that point we can decide whether or not we want to approve or decline that authorization so okay so we're going to do this in our web hook Handler okay so let's go controller okay well hooks controller again we have a whole episode about web hooks the thing that's unique about authorization web hooks is that you can only have one web hook endpoint that is listening for issuing authorization requests and the reason is that we need one source of truth that is deciding whether or not you approve or decline this transaction so that is a that is a little bit nuanced but the the web hook endpoint that you want to listen for is issuing authorization dot request and so we're going to show just how to do that and this is you know in place of setting up those controls directly in your dashboard which you can totally do instead of building a web hook handler if that if that's how you wanted to go so in our web hook handler we need to first skip the CSRF check because we're receiving the post request directly from stripe here and give me more than I wanted okay so in this create method what we're going to do is we're gonna fire up an event that is stripe events from json.parse so this is just gonna like create an event object we're not doing any signature verification obviously you you'll want to go through that web hooks episode in the web hooks best practices there are a number of guides on on stripe about how to about how to handle all of all the best practices and how to handle web hooks signing and verification today we're just going to take the shortcut and construct the event and then handle just the authorization request here so event case on CA the case dot type when it is make sure I get this right issuing authorization at request okay so here this is the point where we need to decide whether we're going to approve or decline the authorization request so approve and/or decline so to demo this what I want to do is I'm gonna say if so the the authorization is going to be stored inside of event data object and if the authorization let's see what is that called if the authorization is pending authorized amount is less than or equal to $50 then we'll approve it otherwise we'll decline it and the way that you approve is you pass the ID of the authorization you want to approve and the way you decline is the same but you're passing it to the decline method and then in addition to passing the ID you can pass other other options here the one I'm going to pass now is just some metadata maybe the reason why I approved this so less less than or equal to the 50s that's how you might do that similarly you can do the same thing with decline you can pass metadata that you might have maybe the reason in more than 50 okay so with previous episodes and with other products it's quite easy to test your webhook handler with the stripe CLI in this case we need a specific webhook endpoint that is listening for this specific event type so it's a little trickier to test with the CLI and I want to make sure that we show you how to test within grok so I actually already have an in grok server running and listening so what I need to do now is in rails I need to add hosts I need to add this in grok domain to the hosts that we want to support okay so we should be able to receive requests from there we need to restart that okay so end rock is a popular tool for forwarding requests that are to a public URL to your local machine so that you can test things so it creates a tunnel where you can then receive requests and so what we're gonna do is go to our stripe dashboard and set up a new a brand-new web hook handler that will pass our events for issuing authorization requests directly to our new and grok endpoint here and we're gonna send those to web books slash web hooks and we want to pick the specific event authorization request at the endpoint okay so now every time I try to charge that card I will be receiving a web hook notification - this - to my local my local host 3000 webhook handler that is being tunneled through and rock and those requests will will enter our web hook handler and either be approved or declined based on how much that item costs or how much that authorization was so let's let's give this a spin I think we need to okay we're gonna restart the real server come back over here to the browser and let's grab our card number again go through a check out okay this is a nine dollar item we expect this to pass okay hey alright it looks like that was successful let's go back to our console so it it looks like we did not receive any requests there so what is going on issuing authorization requests we're in test mode that is the web hook URL issuing authorization request and we restarted the server and okay let's just go back through this entire thing from the top and make sure that we are receiving okay so we're going to add a card holder and three create the cardholder create a card for Jenny demo three go over to that card we'll copy that card number click buy pins go through the process of buying pins and click Buy okay so now if we look at our console we see that we did receive this type issuing authorization request web pop notification and the browser we're back to our success URL so that successfully processed now if we look in the dashboard under issuing we can find that card holder and we can see that we have an authorization here which is successful and the reason metadata is here and we see that that went through successfully that's cool okay so now what I want to do is before we get too far let's go and edit our little test here and say the quantity now is 30 so now we want to buy 30 of those pins this should push push us beyond our limit okay so I'm gonna restart that little test server and go back to the browser and now let's go through this flow again with the same card and now we expect that this should get declined by our web hook handler because it is more than 50 dollars okay pay $90 processing and your card has been declined okay that's great so now if we go back to the dashboard refresh and view our cardholder we see this authorization and we see that it was declined if we drill in there we should see the reason being more than $50 that's the metadata that we passed and so that is how we can pass and set specific metadata and how we can build a web hook handler to process those authorization requests which is really neat because you can look at the merchant you can look at the specifics about the merchant and maybe you only want to allow transactions that happen at gas stations or maybe you only want to allow you know purchasing software or you can you can set dollar amounts for you know per month or per week per day really really exciting things that you can do because in your webhook handler you can decide the logic for approving or declining those issuing authorization requests which is pretty neat okay let me just check here right okay let's go back to the browser in make sure that now if we refresh the page great okay so we're seeing the transactions there that's fantastic okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to pause for a little bit of Q&A so if you have any questions please just drop those in the chat we'd be more than happy to to answer those if you haven't had your question already answered today yeah I think we'd be more than happy to answer those I know that we've had a couple of questions come in already and those look like we've been answering them directly in chat fantastic okay cool okay yeah you know I just really just wanted to say thanks again for joining us for this week's office hours your engagement in in the live chat and your questions are always great to see we hope you found this useful and exciting and if you're interested again you'll want to go out and grab an invite over there at stripe comm slash issuing and if you enjoyed this episode and you want to see other live demos and other stripe office hours we'd love for you to and turn on the notifications there with the Bell we also have a monthly newsletter that we're putting out called the dev digest which you can access and sign up for on most of the pages and the stripe Doc's if you scroll all the way to the bottom you'll see a place where you can enter your email and sign up for that and we promise not to spam to spam that email it's really just for the dev digest and it's a it's a great place where you can learn about new features invites to in-person workshops we talked about the API and the SDK and client library updates that we're doing and often share a lot of fun stuff like the the stripe CLI no additions that are happening to the stripe CLI we have some really cool new additions to our front-end libraries coming out soon and so we will be announcing those in the dev digest so if you sign up there that's the great the best place to stay in the know in the description below we'll have links if you want to go through this guide yourself on github we always share the code from these demos directly on github so you can go check that out and see what that feels like and you know we're always constantly trying to strive to improve these office hours and one of the ways that you can really help us is by submitting that form down below to provide your feedback and let us know you know what you thought of this episode and what you might like in other episodes you know and one of the thing that I'd love to see is if you have a chance just just leave a comment below and tell us what you might build with stripe issuing you know it's such a new exciting API that is so simple to create cards I'd love to hear what what business models you're thinking of and what what new ideas that that are going to come out of this is really exciting API so yeah I think with that I'm just gonna jump over here back to ya signing off all right have a good one we'll see you next time\", metadata={'source': 'knBWhYMqLds', 'title': 'Stripe Issuing', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 12009,

everyone you know how I'm gonna talk a bit more about the trouble of webhooks all the troubles I think I've seen with webhooks my name is Joanne - I'm a developer evangelist at a company called Twilio can I ask who here has heard of Tulio at all before that is almost everyone amazing in that case I probably won't need to tell you about it we do phone calls that's that's it right text messages video chat or three two factor authentication yeah we've got a bunch of stuff we love that European the Europe is putting in whole bunches of like multi-factor authentication stuff into payments cuz like yeah that's a great idea but we're not talking about that we're not talking about team back to litigation on multi-factor authentication today we can talk about web folks and we kind of covered what web book is I found another definition of it which was like it's a user-defined HTTP call back right because you go into the inter into the dashboard of Twilio or a stripe and you say I want you to call this URL I see you define it and that's it it's HTTP that's all we need to know and so the problem is and so and we all use it and we talked about this already everybody how do i poke somewhere along the lines so what's the trouble I always feel the trouble is with that discovery of a new tool or service you're now told as a developer we need to build something with communications or with payments and something like that and it's particularly difficult for us in Twilio because these web hooks actually work synchronously for us when you make a phone call to another when you generate a phone call with a trillion number to somebody else's phone you don't actually tell the thing what to do at that point you give it a URL and that URL to Leo calls makes the web hook to and says what do I do now this cause connected and at that point that's when you have to tell it I don't know fought it to this other person or ask it a question or play a song or something like that and so I always find like yeah if you're in your exploring that new API for that first time and and sure you found like the Tulio node library in this case for example and we've built ourselves a client and you're reading the documentation you know I all right cool I need to create a call and when I create a call I need a from number that makes sense no phone calls come from numbers we'll find out in the Tokyo thing later we've got a to number right that also makes sense and will be probably I'll put my number in there some point but then like the third required thing is this URL and then you look into it alright okay that makes sense that we have to find out what to do with the call next but I was in I was in I was in the node repple here or or you know Python Ruby whatever you you're exploring this with so then you have to like quit all of that yeah all right cool I'll start an Express application or whatever and and and you start the Express segregation you build an endpoint you've got this endpoint then how do you test that and we've we've been through a few of these right you you might throw initial things into the request bin which actually went offline it was a great tool but there's replacement requests bins out there now which you can pay for or post bin which is a free alternative which does work or ultra hook as you mentioned earlier there's another one we've mentioned on the Toyota docks actually called servio which is currently offline due to some sort of phishing scam apparently don't happen there and then there's tunnels n grok local tunnel is another one that I've used in the past we're big fans of and rocket Oreo because it does seem to just work the best and it's absolutely nothing super the fact is actually built by an X trillion as it happens it was kind of cool I didn't know that when I first started using it and Alan Shrieve who's behind is a great developer Shane he's no longer on you oh yeah like whatever let's just push the production that's that's well said I mean will right correct code the first time right I can see senior developers here this is the problem so what can we do about it this is this is what we've been thinking for the last 11 years Twitter turned 11 last week I can't believe it 11 years we're like okay web hooks have been like there from day one as as important so what do we do with this how do we make this better for developers and so here is a bit of a whistle-stop tour of all the ideas and things we've had and they're all pretty much to live I think which is terrifying really because the first one comes from almost that long ago as well as an experiment called twin le'ts which were little applicator that you could create URLs for and use it actually looks like this still looks like this probably look like this on day one it's wonderful because we've got in here the old toyota logo here on the head of who I like to think of as dr. Twilio which we're not allowed to use in any official marketing materials which I would love to look at him he's brilliant but yes so these are actually lose their little PHP applications the code is actually open source we just don't publish it which is an interesting version of open source you you can ask for it somebody has reason it's quite cool and and it would give you things like just just a URL which would forward a call to another number a URL which would sort out voicemail for you and email you a transcription of the of the voicemail itself all sorts of things like that down to an echo to emit which would echo any twimble you put into the URL so it's kind of it was a little dynamic but not that much surprising number of people use this especially since it still looks like this it was an experiment it's never going away but around the same time there are a bunch of early fans of everything's called tweaked or more something and this is because when you respond to a web book request in Twilio you have to respond with some XML that tells Taliah what to do and that it's called Flamel Twilio XML I guess it's a good thing Jason wasn't popular 11 years ago because twice on might have been even weird socially so around yet still 10 9 10 years ago a group of developers who are so big fans of Tullio were like hey we don't want to spin up an application every time we do this and maybe they haven't thought found to emotes and they made turbines or 12 in comm was the actual application which much like request bin or something like that could me give you a unique URL to use but you could actually paste in to a text area there some twirl which you want to return that was cool it would also tell you if it was valid or invalid according to this screenshot I was writing invalid two of the times which is nice to know and we like this so much that she eventually several years later we bought it we bought it off of them and then we integrated it into the Tullio console so I wanted to show you that just quickly right now this is the tutorial console I'm just gonna buy a number that we can use to play around with during this talk and show you how to on wins kind of work now as part of the thing so I'm just gonna grab this phone number my phone and that's the event today cool you'll buy that number and then we're going to set it with a twelve in because something in Jeanette something there we go cool now I own this number when we go to set it up we have all these options to configure it and I got to deal with messaging which is down the bottom there right now and so right now you have this option if a message comes in we can have a web hook but why you have a web hook when we could have a 12 win and not even worry about any kind of local development whatsoever and we can select from our existing normal bins but if it's the first time you're going there you can create one which is even nicer so if I just write myself a quick normal response which always starts with response and ends with response and because this is for messaging I can write a message I'm gonna you actually if you grab your phones and we need to text to this in a minute so I would like you to text in start thinking about it now your favorite emoji because this kind of shows off that we took the static thing and made it a little bit less static because you can put kind of mustache templates in there now and use any parameters that are in the and again this is telling me about my valid tour but you can use any parameters that sent in by the URL or request bodies so if I I've saved the twelve in I save the number and if he's now sent a message send a message to this number it does see +61 but we're all in Australia I assume so it's just zero or plus six one four eight eight eight send in your favorite emoji remember I want to know what they are oh four eight eight eight four one 6:7 - my favorite emoji is the two beers cheering emoji because I like that the Unicode Emporium said and now we've got one beer but what if we had two beers and I know I've got a response from that cool anybody else getting something back from that yes yes nice all right so it's working we got we configured a number and we never left a single webpage is amazing still writing I know favorite emoji is hard there's so many there's new ones now oh my goodness I'm gonna I'm gonna move on because I'll run out of time otherwise so that was cool but we looked at those like little template things right that's cool we can make it a little bit dynamic but this is not a full programming environment yet people want to do full applications with this and that pushed the teams to think about the whole server less thing which was quite exciting actually like the ability to kind of write and run code without having to worry about your servers just inside the the Twilio infrastructure and this kind of came out in 2004 in 2017 and Troyer functions was great because it instantly gave you a URL you had to do that I I had to sweet talk somebody on the team to get Phil got 12 Io nobody else is getting all those and then you just put your code your JavaScript right in here and it would save and deploy and run and that was pretty cool I think anyway I mean there's some downsides to this some people might say JavaScript and be unhappy about that I'm not some people might be that's fine and the other one is you have to write it inside this text area and that's a bit of a shame because that's not how we do our regular development at least that's not how I do it I don't tend to pop open a text area on a web page and start banging away you could install in the configure section you can install NPM modules and stuff in here but that's kind of where we went with that for now we'll come back to this because a different team was taking a different tack at the same time they're like what if you don't even have to know what a web hook is or code or anything like that and they built studio which is just a dragon predator allows you to build conversation flows and initially as a developer I was like you're you're sacking us all but no of course and what's nice about this is it does the the basics very well and then as you want to do custom stuff allows you to either there's a widget for making an HTTP request a widget for invoking one of those functions and so this allowed non-developers product managers other people on the team designers who want to design the flow and actually visualize and see it work with it and again you could if we went back to our number which is over here we can just choose a studio flow instead - but yeah I'm a developer so there's less interested in that and another tack our developer education team are responsible for our documentation and our kind of in-person training events and Talia who's never liked to do things kind of the regular way and so back in 2013 we ran a conference in San Francisco and alongside that the developer event ISM team at the time I was not part of it that's far too long ago but they ran a workshop which they called Twilio quest that was a bit fun it was a bit kind of game oriented but it was a once-off and it it fell over to not be dealt with again then we decided to do in-person workshops again at our conference and actually wanted to kind of expand these to be online as well and so the developer education team picked up this idea of 20 requests and made totally requests to which look like this much more fun a bit more exciting Twitter Quest is a game to find a platform or was twenty quest to is a game if I platform online for learning how to use Twilio and it looks a bit like this you made yourself a little character that's mine I don't know why it's got a mullet right now you can change that and apparently I picked that at one point I mean this is the one for me and you get a little you get XP you get to add stuff to your character and you as you complete missions this is great except of course we still come across the problem that every single time they need to make a web hook we end up with having to do any work and so one of the missions is set up any rock and what what was terrible about this was when we released this to the world not necessarily in person stuff but to the rest of the world there was a bit of a drop-off between people going through missions and in this getting started mission the biggest drop-off was when we got them to set up in Raqqa no I never tool no I'm done so the team went back to the drawing board they were not done with this Tullio quest 3 came out earlier this year which has an even cooler logo I think a little bit more metal actually I this is them this is my favorite so far I want to t-shirt with that on we haven't made them yet but I'm sure we'll get there Twilio Quest 3 they went all out it is a downloadable installable application with a full-on game inside it I can't just tell you about it I need to show you it it's right here this is my Twitter character but I'm going to turn the music on [Music] [Applause] [Music] now of course there is a because that's important especially if you go home operator I am pleased to see you once again [Music] building an entire development they run it in electronics running JavaScript right so we built in an IDE [Music] we come into that down the bottom the game received the technology but if there's and a finger now extend the message receiver [Music] quite an that down for the moment we can play it later though if you want so it's Twilio quest it's one way to use egg rock without even knowing you're using rank rock which is cool so we were not happy with writing text writing code in the text area not happening on the developer Evangeline team but myself and colleague Dominic who's based in San Francisco both sort of came up with different tools and different ideas that we wanted to build grew into what it was a service tool kit for Tullio stuff so Dominic built Twilio Run which was a local kind of mimic environment of of the Troyer functions platform and then I was like that's cool how do we start brought those products easily I created create Tulio function which is a nice little project which just spins up a scaffolded thing and then together we kind of came up with some function templates a lot like the samples that you just saw in the strengths version and those function templates can then connect up with will you run and create really a function to to build new things so I'm going to show that quickly what do we got so I'm just gonna because I called it create really a function you get to then do NPM init toyou function which I think it's cool and let's call it hello strength and I'm actually gonna use template and the template is gonna be it's gonna in this case I can tell you that so MPA a minute is great because you don't have to download and install create relay function in the first place this may take its time because internet and NPM install but doesn't matter no I'm gonna keep talking what does that because it's going to ask me something in a minute and so this little tool yeah is creating a local environment for you to build and Tullio functions with and then run them and then here it is gonna ask me in a minute you hate it when it goes quiet like that flash flash you're supposed to be doing stuff nvm oh I'm supposed to not kick the I have kicked the video cable and possibly it would be a description if that had finished in the meantime we can also list the templates which is nice I can't remember the year there mean one but then let's go see what they're supposed to be called I just want to make sure I did spell it right you know right who knows I never know how to use flags and they should both work let's leave that doing that for a second I'll come back to in a minute that's the demo this was the unofficial logo of the service toolkit because the team building the the severest platforms weren't building these tools and every time we told them about a new thing the project manager the product manager said he was happy as a CEO with a french fry and so if you've been to the beach recently you know what that's like work you bastard all right we'll come back to in a minute and then eventually we built CLI as well this year which was announced and released in August I don't actually know what the driving thing for the CLI was initially it wasn't I don't think it was actually webhooks we just wanted to be able to do everything on the API via a CLI by the command-line interface so you can do things like using the core API and list out your messages we can currently list our debug logs we're working on streaming them that will be nice in the future but one of the fancy little things we did include in it was a way to tunnel to your phone number and so I'm going to come back to that ins yes so this is nice it's asking me about my account credentials and now it's totally do the templates and now it's installing other things around the end so we'll come back to that in a minute because I have the Twilio CLI over here and so there's a bunch of stuff has also complete that's important because when you go down the API core and then order completing that kind of stuff is useful but I'm going to do that right now I'm going to use the phone numbers section gin and I gotta update our phone number so that was the phone number that we got earlier which is not never gonna let's get back to you here and get my phone number and you know update it I'm gonna set the voice URL - you know said it's a local host and this is the fancy thing it will be running a Lagos 3,000 never if we do that well it's gonna do actually detected we're trying to set the local host spin up and rock in the background and give us an Iraqi URL that is now pointing around so that's there this now works so if I had CD into hell that's better CD into hello strap and run NPM start that's going to start up Tulio Run which is then created this function in point so this n grok URL is now pointing at that and so if I copy that oops let's just grab that not load it grab it I can go back over here and what I can actually do is just kind of let messages and go get those messages that we send earlier using that client quiet messages list gonna list the messages that were to that number not that messages you having to copy the number messages that were to the number we bought earlier once we've got those out set messages to them that's nice easy one that shouldn't take us too long probably alright we had 22 messages that's nice that's pretty cool so using those messages I can now kind of run through them and what we can console.log everybody's favorite emoji that's the body of the message you were good right I trust you for now and then we can create calls back calls that create I'm going to create that call from as I said the number we bought earlier to end up from which is the number you've sent the message from and then a URL which is which we know the URL is this one which is created by the CLI for us and then if we just close that loop that's gonna run through all these messages it's going to show us all these emojis but it's also going to start this close calls which are going to run against the thing running on my laptop right now so cool dropped a memesters nice and you should find your phone start to ring in a second I've got mine yeah nice tell you so you knew what was coming I guess it's kind of telegraphed in the whole thing but as we can see those post requests are all coming in from the from the web hooks that being sent from the API to get that synchronous API response back to us and it was all because we just updated the phone number to a local host URL that should keep going for a little while cool so the CI allows you to do that which is quite cool and then even better I thought was doing it I like that we actually built the CLI not in go which I thought would have been a nice idea because of that ability to build releases for all platforms we actually chose Heroku so cliff node.js library which has allowed us still to produce C lies for debian-based Linux right now I don't think we've got other ones and Windows a Mac you can install via NPM or brew or I think we might have done a Windows thing that I don't use Windows so I can't remember it but it also meant that people could in there anybody in the company didn't have to learn go it's not a language use that much at all you so you can build our CI plugins or indeed features into the CLI using JavaScript which we like and you can build your own and so that service toolkit I talked about before which was made up of three in fact to another service API plot module as well has now been built up into a server let's plug in and actually you can see that and stop it truly help we've got a service one down the bottom also token as a plug-in as well which does things with them JD be teased that we need for Tory so the CLI then allows us to expand this with user contributions as well and so that was the trouble with notebooks I find it's really hard for people to get started with web hooks if they'd not use them before and it's a pain if you have no one was pleased with it when when Thor asked earlier and so we've attacked this on multiple fronts as you can see simple applications using this to emulate sort well winds as part of education we try and bring people onto and rock with truly o quests but also kind of hide and rock away inside to leo quest as well non developers can use non developers and developers can use studio to build stuff and then for an actual developer environment the service toolkit and the trolley or CLI allows to build and automate things and the service platform actually has an epi now so you can develop on your laptop using servers toolkit to deploy apps to production to test locally deploy to production and be happy so that's all the stuff we've done with web hooks it's willingham I've had a breath if you are interested in this go play Julia quests will come slash quest it's a lot of fun for a documentation platform and if you are interested in any of those open-source projects things around the toy your service toolkit then gone slash Twilio Labs is where we're doing that the sea lion itself actually lives at to github.com slash Twilio slash truly ocmi but it's also part maintained by a robot because we're not writing all those api's there's hundreds of them and that's all I've got for you thank you so much for joining us in this evening my name is Arash I work at rollio thank you [Applause] [Music]\", metadata={'source': '3_zjCbfJG3c', 'title': '\"The trouble with

'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] in this episode we cover foundational topics and dig into the basics of Python and the flask web framework how they work together and how we use flask as a base for developer office hours episodes and also in our stripe samples which is a collection of github repositories demonstrating integrations with many different stripe products so you might be just getting started and are curious about how to build a web application from scratch to take your first online payment and so this episode will cover some basics to help you get started quickly with Python and flask so if you've already got a back-end set up and you're comfortable with like adding new routes and are looking to add a new stripe integration you might want to check out some of the other office hours episodes we have where we show how to integrate specific stripe products and features so why flask flask in its own words is a Python web framework built with a small core and easy to extend philosophy so this allows us to keep the code for a demo concise well also still showing a real working example so it might be helpful to watch and refer to a couple other videos before watching this episode so number one is the episode about managing environment variables with Python specifically the Python 10 package and the second being the introduction to the stripe CLI which really powerful command-line tool so as a quick agenda for today we're going to cover how to set up a client with a basic static HTML page and some stripe j/s installed then we'll install dependencies with pip we'll implement basic flask server adding some get routes and some post routes and finally we'll set up a super simple post route that you can use as your web hook handler all right let's jump in and take a look at what we might build today so if you wanted to kind of just jump through time and go to the end and see what we're gonna build one tool that you can use and you can also use this when we're going through office hours to install this base in this template is by using the stripe CLI you can say stripes samples list and that gives you the list of all the different stripe samples that you have access to today we're working with a developer office hours stripe sample which is actually a starter for all of the office hours that we're gonna do moving forward and it includes the boilerplate doesn't actually have the integration but it includes the boilerplate so you can install that by saying stripe samples create and then passing in the name of the stripe sample so developer office hours in this case and that'll allow you to pick which server you want to use in this case we're talking about Python and that creates a directory called developer office hours and this is what we're gonna implement today so we have a client directory and a server directory and in the client director we have just a really simple index.html page in the server directory we have a simple flask server pi so this is what we're gonna what we're gonna build today is just this starter so if you wanted to kind of jump to the end and just use that there you go otherwise follow along as we build this from scratch so I'm just gonna remove that directory and we're gonna start here with creating two directories client and server and then we're gonna first implement the client just a really basic client so client index.html this is a blank file and we're gonna start off with just adding some basic HTML so developer office hours might be the title drop in some CSS for structure and a couple of divs with a header tag here at the bottom we want to install stripe j/s so the way that you do that is by adding a script tag that points at the stripe j/s library so it looks just like this and you want to make sure that your script tag does not have defer or async in that it is polling directly from jst stripe comm so that you always have the the most up-to-date version of the stripe client the stripe GS clam now for developer office hours will often write the JavaScript related to a page directly in line so in an inline script tag for some of the stripe samples will include a JavaScript a JavaScript file that lives in the client directory that we refer to and pull in from the HTML client so we'll have a script tag with a source points to a javascript file in the project for office hours we're gonna do it in line just so we have everything on screen you can kind of see as we build so most often will initialize an instance of stripe and in this case I have hard-coded the publishable key but we want to change the way we're doing that and instead fetch the publishable key from the server so add a little to do that go fetch that publishable key from the server so this is kind of the baseline HTML that we'll start with and yeah let's go ahead over install some dependencies and get started on the server so I'm going to change directory into the server directory here and then I'm going to use Python - 3 - ahem then then to create a virtual environment here and I can say dot then slash bin slash activate to activate the virtual environment and then I want to use pip to install dependencies I'm gonna say pip install and in this case we need a handful of dependencies we're gonna use flask we're also going to use stripe and Python dot dot n to manage our environment variables again we have that other episode of managing environment variables if you're curious ok great so that's installing all of our dependencies the next thing I'm gonna do is copy in my dot N file which holds my striped keys ok so now that we are installed we can go implemented ah server dot pi ok so again this is going to start off as a blank file and the very first thing I want to do is just load our environment variables and make an API request to stripe just to make sure that things are working as expected so let's import stripe and let's also import OS that's going to be the package we use to access our environment variables and then nest next we're going to install all the dependencies that are that come from flask so say from flask import flask capital the the class flask we also want to use rendered template for sending back some HTML where else can you use JSON fi for sending back JSON in a response we want to use we want access to the request and that I think that should do it let's see and then the next thing we want to do is import the tools to load our environment variables so from dot n we want to import load end and find dot n okay and so the way that we load those environment variables is we simply say load dot n and we pass in find dot int and execute that ok so now we should be able to set our stripe API key so we're gonna initialize the stripe API key by saying stripe that API key equals OS get and and then we pass in stripe secret key that installs or that just sets the API key on stripe so that we can make authenticated API requests and then the next we want to do is just test this out so let's see if our if our secret key was initialized correctly and if week if we can receive some plans back maybe from our account that will tell us if we're using the right API key so now we want to try something like maybe just print stripe dot pland list and that should fetch our plans if we have any defined in our account if we don't have any we should still see some JSON with like an empty array for the plans that would have returned so let's head over to our server directory and say Python server and we do we get back some JSON with our plans so that is working as expected that's totally great cool so let's go add a get route that should just return so we're gonna we're gonna start working with flask now we'll install a simple get route for the route route that we want to eventually return our HTML directly from the index.html page that we defined before so let's start really simply and add a method here and we'll call it index and we want index to just return hello stripes kind of like the hello world here of flat and now the way that we tell this method that it is a route is by using this app dot route decorator so we say at after out and we pass in some config options about the route in this case because it's a get request and it's very default we can just pass the string for the path that we want this method to return the result for so we say app dot route slash and that defines a route so when a request comes into our server for the route route it will execute this index function and return the string hello stripe Dib so that's what we should see when we make a request that should be there is the the body of the response that we get and then finally here at the bottom we need to start up the app and actually run it so we say app dot dot run and we pass in port 4 - 4 - and I'm remembering here that I didn't actually initialize an instance of app so we need to do that also so the way that we can initialize an instance of app is we say app equals flask so we call this like we are kind of like constructing an instance of flask here and we pass in underscore underscore name and that is the name of the current file followed by static folder and our static folder is a sibling of the server directory so the directory were in now is service we want to go up one and over to client that's gonna be our static folder we also want to pass in static URL path which is just the empty string and then we also want to define the template folder so that we can use this render template method so we say template folder is the same thing as the static folder so dot dot slash client and that should initialize an instance of app for us ok let's just go test and see if this is working as expected so we want to go back to our server directory here and say Python server that should start an instance of a flask so now we're we're serving the flask ask app called server which was the name of the the file here and then we can use a command line tool called curl to make an HTTP request to our local running server curl is a command lined HTTP clients very simple so we can say curl localhost for two for two and this will make a get request to our server so let's just see if that worked ok so the output of curl we get back hello stripe devs just as expected and in our server logs we can see that there was a get request made for slash HTTP 1.1 and we responded with a 200 ok and here is that response great let's push it one step further and see if we can get this to return some HTML so rather than just returning the string hello stripe devs instead we want to also say you know render template we want to tell it the name of the template in this case index.html okay so with that simple change we'll restart the server and see if we can get that HTML back and we did so that looks great and now we can actually click on this link and open up localhost 4 - 4 - and we see that's the HTML that we wrote so that is working great next step let's add another get route to our server that will respond with the publishable key that is stored in the environment variables and we can use that to make a request from our client to fetch the publishable key and set that and this also demonstrates how you might make other get requests to your server using javascript alright so we want to go back to the server we want to add another get route this time we need to pass a new and different path name so this is the the path in the URL that the request is going to match in this case we want to say maybe something like public key maybe public keys and we'll make the method called public underscore keys this is a pretty common convention and what we want to do is return in this case we're returning JSON so we want to say JSON Fi and then we're gonna pass in an object here that has key and the value of the key which is in our environment variable so we can say oh s get and stripe publish key I think public key will work ok great so within a get route you can receive some arguments usually as query string parameters but you can also maybe you might have like some arguments in the path this is a very simple example where we're just returning something that was in the environment variables you might also you know access something in your database and return some JSON or you might make a get request to some API to fetch something and then return that as part of JSON so this is just how you make a very simple get route on your server and in this case we're just returning an environment variable let's go restart our server test this out so if we say curl local host for two for two slash public keys that'll make a get route to our public keys endpoint and we do indeed get back this key with publishable key and that looks great that looks just as if we expect so now let's go use this new route on our client so if we go back to our index dot HTML page and rather than setting the publishable key this way we want to instead make a call to our server public keys ok so I'm using a an HTTP client that is just vanilla JavaScript it comes bundled with browsers it's called fetch and like most HTTP clients you can pass in a couple of configuration values and variables that allow you to configure the request and then you can work with the response that you get back a synchronously so in this case because we're making a simple get request we just pass in the string value for the path that we want to make a request to from the client so we say fetch public keys and this returns a promise that resolves with this response object that itself has a JSON method that returns in another promise that when resolved resolves with this data object which has the JSON for the response that we returned so in this case we want to set stripe equal to again we're gonna use that stripe constructor function and pass in data key to initialize a new instance of stripe and so this way we are storing our publishable key in an environment variable fetching it on the client when we initialize that way we can change between environments really easily so we're just modifying environment variables on the server rather than passing in or like hard coding the the publishable key on the client so it's a little bit better practice especially when using mobile clients so if you're on iOS or and you definitely want to fetch your publishable keys from the server just so that you can have a lot more control over if you need to roll a public a public key for some some reason so all right so now we have made this fetch let's go see if it works so in the server we actually need to restart the server here and then we can go back to the browser and refresh this page but I wanted to show you you can access the chrome developer tools by right-clicking and going to inspect this is common across many browsers so you you will often have some sort of developer console with developer tools the chrome developer tools are very powerful we have when you first open it up I usually do use a command option I in the sort of the thumb smash I to open this you see a bunch of tabs across the top we're gonna use today we're going to use sources in the network tab but there's a lot of handy resources in the rest of these tabs that I would highly recommend becoming well accustomed with so in the sources tab if we find the index page that we just loaded and we can scroll down and you can use the JavaScript debugger by clicking on a line number in the gutter here and then refreshing the page and that will break execution of your code at that point so that you can inspect values and variables so here we want we can hover over strike and we see that it's currently undefined because we're about to execute this fetch function now you can use these these buttons on the right to step through as you're executing so once you're confident that your code is reaching a certain point you can remove the breakpoint and click play that resumes execution note that the fetch command here is making a network request to 127 to 0 to 0 to 1 so our port 4 to 4 to slash public keys and they're the data that we got back is indeed this data here which we can hover over and kind of like inspect we see that it did return a key it is this PK test it's our publishable key so that is great we can remove that breakpoint and click play I also want to show the network tab so if you go to the network tab here and we scroll down we can see our this request for public keys and we also see that it was a 200 ok if go to the preview you can see the data that was returned pretty handy if this was a post request here at the bottom you would see the payload for the post body that's being sent from the browser I think we're looking good that is working as expected let's head over to the server to add a new route that receives post requests and then we'll add a button here on the client to just send a simple a simple post request back to our browser or I'm sorry back to it back to the server okay so back to our server file we want to add a new route that receives post requests so it's very similar to a get request here we say app dot route and then we pass in the path that we want to receive post request to my route we'll just call it something simple and then in the case that you want to support post requests you can pass this second argument to app dot the app dot route decorator here where we say methods equals and then a list of HTTP methods we want to support with this specific route so we're gonna say post so that we can receive post requests so we'll call it my underscore route and inside of this route what we want to do is initially we'll just respond by echoing back the data that we received and what kind of like nested under nested under a key so that we can kind of just get and get a sense for what's happening within this function so we might say something like we turn JSON of Phi our request which is going to be request JSON and so this allows us to respond and we'll just kind of like echo back the data that we received now a couple of things to note inside of your post route this is where you're typically going to be adding things to the database making API calls creating some resources so you might be creating a payment or creating the customer or taking some action like you know creating a like or a comment so that this is the way that you can think of this is the post route is handling all of the data that might be collected up by a form or by a button click it's receiving all of those checkboxes and radio buttons that you've selected maybe files they've uploaded and it's receiving all of that data and making decisions about that and creating a resource ok so a pull trout is the thing that handles when data is being sent to your server a big big chunk of data okay so this for now let's also just print out like request JSON test so we'll test this out by passing in some test value and maybe we can say like print this is test okay all right so now we have a new route first let's test it with curl so we start our server and we can use curl with a with - X so curl - capital X post this allows us to pass in the HTTP method that we want to use so we want to make a post request to localhost four - four - my route and we want to pass in some data so the data that we're gonna pass in can can be a JavaScript object so we can use - D and we want to in single quotes we'll pass our JavaScript object here test is one two three and we also wanted to tell the server that we're passing JSON so we now can say - H content type is application JSON okay we received in error that's great we we failed here and so in our server log we see the error we see that when we tried to execute curl we got back a 500 internal server error all right so let's go investigate so if we read the error response here error in App exception on my route alright let's go to the very bottom name error name ryu 'xs is not defined so I spelled request wrong in our route so let's go fix that so this is this should be request ok restart the server and let's execute that same curl command and all right great so this is test we get the value one two three we passed in one two three let's just for fun let's change this to one two three lots of zeros so we get that value there in the server also and we are the response is echoing back this is our request and that's kind of got the body there so it's how we can pass in data with a post request from curl let's go see how we can do it from the client so if we jump back over here and go back to our our HTTP client let's add a button here that just has ID BTN and we'll say click me ok so this is how we can add a post request to our client so the first thing we want to do is grab reference to the button and then add a click handler so that when the button is clicked we execute something and then in the body of the click handler we'll make a post request back to our new my route and we'll pass back some just some fake data so we want to grab reference to the button and we can do that by using this document dot get element by ID because we set the ID attribute on the the HTML button that grabs reference to the button so we can interact with it with JavaScript we want to add a click handler so that looks like this we call BTN add event listener we pass in the name of the event we want to listen for in this case click and then we pass a callback function as the second argument to add event listener and this callback function is what is invoked when that event happens in this case and the callback is passed the actual event object which has a method prevent default which you can you can call so that the event that is executing doesn't bubble up so in this case if you have a button that's inside of a form and you don't prevent default then when the button is clicked that click event will bubble up to the form and the form will execute a submit event which oftentimes will cause a full page redirect so most commonly I'm making calls back to the server with Ajax and using JavaScript so I almost always prevent default here so I'm preventing default I'm going to make it now a call back to the server making a post request again with fetch so the first argument here is my route that's the path that we want to make the request to and the second argument is this option object that takes in method which you can pass as the the method that we want to make or the the type of HTTP request where you're making it as a post you can also pass in headers again we want to set the content type to application JSON so the server knows the data it's receiving is JSON it knows to like sort of parse that out as JSON and then we want to pass in the body which is the string string if I had JSON objects in this case we'll pass tests again maybe we'll say you know ABC one two three we could also pass a customer like cuss xxx we might also pass a payment method so maybe we tokenize the payment with the stripe j/s or something I want to pass that back to our server we can say p.m. card visa which is one of our test cards I also wanted to show that you can you can send nested data this way too so you might have an address that itself has a line 1 you know Main Street or something and this could you know be further nested like type I don't know you might you might go even deeper with your nesting of the object that you're passing back to the server and that's totally supported and totally works the this fetch again the same way that it works with a get request when you make a post request it resolves with a promise that you can use this JSON method to return the JSON object that was returned in the response in this case we'll just console.log that data again all right so now that we've implemented our client let's go restart our server and go back to the browser and test this in the browser so refresh the page we now have a big beautiful click Me button if I clear the network tabs you can click on this no smoking sign to clear the network tab and then if you click on the click Me button we see a network request was fired off if we click on it we see that it was a post request to my route if we scroll to the bottom here we can also see all the headers that were sent if we scroll to the bottom we see the payload the request payload so this was the post body that we sent looks all well-formed and then if we go to the preview tab we see the response that came back from the server so we see the response comes in with that request key that we added it includes the address customer payment method and this test value that we sent and we did console.log that here to the console again if we wanted to we could use the sources tab to set some breakpoints and see okay if I put a breakpoint right inside the callback function for clique if I click on the click button then it breaks right there and I can sort of step through what's happening so that's super handy all right I'm just gonna play through and I believe that looks good we can go check our server log to see that we did receive the this test value we did abc123 so everything is looking really good for our post so that's how you can add a get route and a post route and how you might interact with the values that came back so again you know in your in your post in your post route handler you might do something with the data that's coming back here so request a JSON test or request a JSON customer to set the value of the customer or the payment method or what have you alright let's move on to the final step of our integration for today which is adding a post route to handle a web hook event so similar to this it's going to be a a route that receives methods of type post and the path will call it web hook all right so our web hook handler is going to be very simple today we have a separate episode about working with web hooks you can go check that out for more details there's a ways that you can verify the signature you typically do not want to have authentication on the web hook instead you use signature verification where stripe is passing a special header that you can match against a web hook secret again go check out the web hook episode we're not going to handle any of that today but I wanted to just like take a step back and talk about web hooks in general so a web hook is a way for you to tell a third party where to send post requests when events happen so in this case when events happen on your stripe account for instance an invoice is created or a customer's created or a payment is successful you can take action so I want to show you really quickly in the stripe documentation we have there is a massive list of event types here so if you go to stripe comm slash dock slash API slash event slash types there's a massive of all the different event types that you might receive so charged at dispute funds withdrawn one of the most common is invoiced I've created this allows you to take action every time a subscription is renewing before the before it's finalized you have a invoice payment failed if you want to send it some sort of email to the customer there's a huge number of different web hook event types that you might receive so payout failed and so today what we're gonna do is just show a very simple example of how to implement like the most basic web hook endpoint handler here another thing I want to mention is that users never see this web hook endpoint they never interact with it the only time that you're going to receive requests on the web hook end point is when stripe is sending you some data about something that happened this is all asynchronous the customer never ever views this page this there's no redirect that happens inside of a web hook in fact if you redirect it's considered sort of an error you must respond with a 200 response to stripe in your web handler so the web hook is really just a way for you to automate different parts and application logic that depends on when events happen on stripe alright so all that said let's get started here so we want to add in a new event so we say event equals striped uh event construct from and we pass in the first argument is the the JSON data that we received so here we're gonna say request that JSON the second argument is our stripe key so OS get in again stripe secret key and that will construct an event object an event object has a type so we can say maybe if the event dot type is payment intent created then we want to print payment intent was created now you might take another action here you might this this is where you might fulfill some sort of order the event type or so the event is a sort of generic object that has a type and it has a couple other attributes but one of the is that it has this object this data object and that is going to be of the shape of a real object in the Striped api so in this case for payment intent created the type of the object we're getting back is a payment intent so we can say maybe here we can say payment intent equals event data object okay we might also handle other event types so if event type is checkout session dot completed in that case the event type is going to be a or the event data object is going to be of type check out session so in this case we can say maybe like the session is event data object okay and then we can print you know check out check out session completed okay in both of these cases let's also log the ID of the object so we can say payment intent ID and for checkout session we'll say check out session the ID we can also print things like the status of the payment and payment intent dot status okay so you have access to the full object there which is very handy and allows you to automate a ton of things based on events that are firing in your account so if you want to add support for a new event type you just add a new if statement here that handles that that type of event finally we do want to return something valid so we want to return here JSON Fi just like maybe message is success and this is the response that's being sent back to stripe and you'll be able to see this in your stripe dashboard okay let's go test and see if this is working as expected we're going to use the stripe CLI to run some basic tests so we want to restart our server and then we can use stripe listen forward to localhost four - four - slash webhook so the stripe listen command creates a direct connection from stripe to your local machine and allows you to forward the requests that are coming from stripe the post requests that are coming from stripe to this local web book handler this allows you to sort of avoid needing the use of a tunnel or publishing your code to some public URL while while still testing your webhook endpoints very powerful we go into much more detail in the stripe CLI episode so if you wanted to you can check that out the next thing I want to show you is that we can use the stripe trigger command to cause an event type to happen so payment intent created so we say stripe trigger we pass in the event type that we want to fire and under the hood stripe CLI is going to build up and make an API request that results in this type of event so for payment and creates a simple request we fire off a payment we fire off a request to create a payment intent and this payment intent created event fires and we see in our server log that payment intent was created we see the ID here for the payment intent and the status there's no space there but statuses requires payment method that's totally expected and so that looks like it's working great let's also trigger checkout session completed so for a checkout session to complete there's a few other things that need to happen so it needs to you know create a payment page create a payment method create a customer there's charges that are successful payment intents that are successful so we're seeing a whole bunch of different requests come through we saw this checkout session completed event fire and we actually got back a 500 HTTP status code from our server so in this case it looks like we have another error so we have we have this call or I guess we go straight to the bottom of the error message here we say name error name checkout underscore session is not defined I think I called it session so let's go see if we can fix that yeah so here event outdated object I stored it in a variable called session and then I tried to access it with checkout underscore session so ID I don't need that first part of the name so let's go restart the server and try this again so checkout session completed we can see all of the requests are being built up to result in a checkout session completed event we say the payment intent was created and the other HTTP requests are coming through all with to hundreds we are expecting this checkout session completed to fire and there's the the ID of the checkout session there at the end so that is all looking good and that is really the baseline for for the boilerplate in the starter for working with stripe Python and with flask for for office hours so that that completes the content for today's episode really thank you for for listening and for sticking around we I hope that was super useful we have thick skin so if you have feedback for us please let us know in the feedback form below remember that we you are you're not alone when you're building your integration we're here with you we want to help you build your business so if you have any questions at all as you're going through and building this out feel free to jump on IRC with us we're in the freenode channel called stripe otherwise you can head up support that stripe comm with any other questions yeah again please let us know if you found this useful and we'll see you in other office hours episodes Cheers you\",

'2020-04-23 00:00:00', 'length': 2202, 'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] hello and welcome to developer office errors my name's Matthew Ling I'm a developer support engineer here at stripe today's episode is a second in a series of getting started with clarinha as a payment method and if you haven't watched the first episode I do recommend it it's only 15 minutes and it does bag presents some fundamentals about getting started with the client and we're going to be building on those today in this integration in these on priests and at the times you may want to offer your customers an alternative to paying upfront for your goods and services and client it does enable that by allowing your customers to choose to pay overtime in installments or indeed to pay later now the interesting thing about that is that you as the merchant receive all of the funds immediately and climb to does all of the heavy lifting to collect the funds from your customers so let's jump straight into a demo to see how that might look okay so as we were in the first episode we're still selling some t-shirts but instead of - redirecting directly over to Clara we will present the user the option to choose from paying immediately slicing in in two installments or to pay later so if I choose to slice it up in the German shop I can pay in six twelve or twenty four installments I'll just go ahead and choose 24 after some payment details these are test strings from Plata and submit you and we're done so the agenda for this integration is that we'll use the stripes UI to bootstrap a sample project from developer office hours we unpack the payment categories from the client source that will create and then we'll present those options to the user and so that they can choose how to pay the sample code for this integration is on github arm at stripe samples and as always they're stripe engineers here in chat and live online to field your questions or on IRC on freenode so if you have any questions please ask away ok so let's dive into some code okay so I'm just gonna cancel out of that and jump into a working directory mm-hmm okay so on the first part of the agenda or the first item on the agenda rather it was we are going to use the stripe see light - scuse me create a sample and a sample project so if I look at stripe samples list we can see a list of all the different types of projects that we can bootstrap using stripe CLI it's really a lot here and it's really really useful and whether it's getting started with subscriptions or accepting simple payments okay but we are going to create a sample using the developer office hours template and I am going to choose Ruby for us okay and then let's jump into the directory and it's given us two directories and clients on a server and with the index.html and the server Ruby and along with the jump file for specifying which gems we're going to be using okay cool so let's have a look at the code that we got for that and we have the stripe client library Sinatra and our emerging environment variables are pretty standard for our developer office hours demos and but what we also have is a route route on slash and a fairly fleshed out web hook endpoint which uses the web book secret and checks whether the event was genuinely sent from stripe by checking the signature scent in the header and there's another episode on both web hooks and stripes you lied by CJ and I highly recommend you you check those out too and okay cool so we're gonna try and reuse a lot of the code that we wrote in the first episode and so then we're not repeating ourselves so jump into the server directory I'm going to copy the views from the other client the first part demo so let's get everything that we had I'm dropping into the clients directory okay let's see did that work yeah cool cool so we have the products er B which listed our products and the success page for saying thank you to the customer mmm we're also going to take the server code that we wrote and so let's grab some code from the Barna Ruby file so we had an in-memory database of products the success roof the purchase route action action and which created the source and and we have the products action okay I'm going to take that much first I'm gonna paste it here got it indent that too mm-hmm and I'm also going to grab the charge creation so in the first episode we listened out for the source chargeable event so when the connoisseurs is chargeable as after the user has provided their payment details we listen for source charge Mon then we actually create that charge so we're gonna take at least this charge code here and I'll drop it here I think so we'll be listening it for that event type okay okay so we can fit we'll have to change this a little bit but we can fix it up later okay so let's run the server and see what we have okay so this is the route and so there's actually nothing there yet so let's go back to the server code and let's redirect redirect to products okay I'm gonna have to restart the server okay cool so now we're listing out the products in the products view um so we haven't made any changes to the purchase route so that will actually redirect us directly over to client to pain now so what we're gonna do is we're going to extract all the different types of payment method categories whether it's now later or in installments and we're gonna offer those to the user they can choose themselves ok cool so that's the purchase action so let's just so we're going to delete this so the payment methods categories um is part of the source that we created here so depending on the country that you are selling in so in this case in Germany there will be different types of method categories so it's it's useful to actually pull those eyes and then you can automatically show the applicable categories per country and so in Germany anyway a we grab the corner object and we ask for the pin method categories now I happen to know that's a string so we need to split the string up over the commas so now we have an array of payment method categories there so I'm gonna write the ER be render method first or code first so we're gonna we are going to render this and what we're gonna do is pass a set of local variables to that view so what will be in there okay we are going to pass the categories that we can loop over the categories and then generate those buttons that we saw in the demo so the key will be payment method categories will pass the array of categories and I'm also going to pass the the whole harder object M which contains the actual redirection URLs that we'll need okay cool and we don't have that view yet so let's copy that from the products so we're gonna need to copy the client products er B we're gonna call it let's just grab this yeah that's the same mmm yeah be cool and okay let's jump in there and make some edits okay so the products here be listed the product in the table so we're just gonna get rid of this and say maybe here choose a payment method yeah and we're gonna loop over the payments method categories category can't take yep and that loop there and I'm gonna cheat a little bit I get some padding by using a field set per button and what I'd like to do here is actually to generate the name for the button by looking into the Clara object and I happen to know we want to use a symbol here to to key into that hash and will interpolate the category oops category and this is the name so that's the that's the name of that attribute in the hash and we should actually have put it here oops name okay so let's start the server again and see what we have okay refresh that so we should now hit the payment method categories okay on to find local method variable or method - I've got a typo I've admitted something here so let's just go back to the server ah yes come on okay cool that should solve that problem now we should have three buttons with the three different payment method categories that apply to Germany okay now these are going to do nothing because I haven't actually pulled out the redirection URLs so let's let's jump back into the view mmm it's pretty much the same deal let's generate the URL based on the contents of the attributes in the car in a hash this is the redirect URL and we click yeah it's gonna be location address and we're gonna send the user to the URL so make sure have that right URL kind of how to redirect you on click location page ref okay cool great so let's refresh that page okay so let's click through so if I wanted to pay now that's perfect so I provide my banking details if I want to pay later great I can pay in 14 days or in 3 months or if I want to slice it into installments I can also do that too so before maybe completing this payment flow I'm gonna start the stripe CLI listening to events I'm going to forward them to our local server web book and we do need to pay a little bit of attention there so mmm so the event here is being verified against the signature and so once we get to here we know that we've got a legitimate event so based on the type so we call this a source the ax type we wanted to listen for his source chargeable mm-hmm okay I need to change this to euros since I am charging in euros in my German shop okay and that should be enough so I have to restart the server okay cool so let's see if that's worked we should see that the source becomes chargeable the the source is charged and that the charge succeeded and then we're going to check in the dashboard to see what happened okay so I obviously have given my tests and data details previously source becomes chargeable great so it posted to our web hook the web hook returned with a 200 ok which says to stripe great we receive the event everything's ok we created the charge and the charge succeeded so I jump in to the dashboard [Music] okay we're gonna go to here and that's the t-shirts okay and payments and there's the 1010 euros and April 8th yeah perfect all the times much up so that is my act in my charge or my current charge for this connoisseurs and we're done so that's another short and sweet integration with stripe using chlorine a-- and hopefully an indication of how simple it is to be able to offer your customers flexible payment options if you have any questions comments or feedback on this episode please do contact us on support dot Stratcom or on IRC on freenode and thank you so much for joining us looking forward to seeing you again

unprecedented times at stripe our priority is to help you serve your customers and keep your payments infrastructure operating reliably businesses all around the world are responding quickly to these new circumstances and if you find yourself quickly needing to move your services online you can use the stripe dashboard to also move your payments online today we want to look at sending invoices from the stripe dashboard without writing any code with stripe billing we can send one of invoices from the stripe dashboard once we've created our account we can click through in the billing section to read the QuickStart guide today we want to create invoices and we can do this without writing any code right from the stripe dashboard first let's actually look at the settings for our invoices when we click through the stripe settings we can configure the invoice template we can set our branding in the branding settings we can specify our own logo and icons and also our brand color to make sure the customer recognizes the invoice as well as the payment page secondly we specify the business information so they have a support email address and phone number that they can reach out to if they need to we can specify the invoice numbering whether it should be numbered sequentially for each customer or across all customers on your account we can set a default memo as well as a default footer and we can specify the payment terms we can set that the payment is to you in 30 days or under the current circumstances we could extend it to 90 days we can include a stripe hosted payment page which customers can click through in the invoice to then pay the invoice online here we've enabled ACH bank transfers as well as credit and debit card payments but for customers in other regions we can also enable additional local payment methods now if we go back to billing we go to the invoices section and we can click to create a new invoice when we have a new account we need to create customer details let's send an invoice to Jenny Rosen here we need to add Jenny we can add in description as well as specify the billing information and if the customer is a business if we're sending a b2b invoice we can also specify a tax ID if we have that for the business in Europe for example some b2b invoices are v80 exempt so here we would want to specify the tax the tax ID for our customer now that we have the customer created we can add items to our invoice let's say we've done some web development work for Jenny and it's some smaller work so we're gonna build 500 US Dollars and now we can also apply a tax right we currently don't have any tax rate set so here we can quickly leave the invoice which will be saved as a draft and we can go over to the tax write section to add a tax rate we can select between different types depending which part of the world we're in in Europe we charge Li 80 and Australia GST for example and here in the US let's select say it's tax we can specify a region I believe the sales tax in California is 7.25% and it's exclusive so it is charged on top of the invoice and let's call it California say it's tax now we can go back to our invoices we can open our draft here we can set an item tax rate so if we were to sell digital items as well as physical items in one invoice we could set different tax rates per item but let's set a default tax rate here and add this to the invoice so we can see the tax sales tax amount that is added to the invoice and the total amount here and now we want to say we want to email the invoice to the customer so they can pay manually we want to extend this to say 90 days and now we can sent the invoice you can see see if Jenny has an accountant we can also specify their email address here and now we can send off this invoice when we send it off the draft will move to a finalized invoice and here are the details that are being sent via email to our customer they will receive a payment link that they can click through on the invoice to get to a stripe house--at payment page here they can pay it with their cart or an ACH bank transfer let's select cart we can use the test card details here and test mode and we can pay the invoice once the customer has paid the invoice they can download the receipt they will also receive the email receipt which you can specify in the billing settings but they can also download the invoice for their records so this generates an invoice PDF for them which they can keep if we go back to the stripe dashboard in the payment section we can now see the payment that the customer has made from the hosted invoice if we need to provide a refund to the customer we can also do this by issuing a credit note so here we can issue a credit note we can select the items that we want to credit back here in this case we credit back the whole invoice once we issue the credit note the customer will receive a refund as well as an email with the credit note with the stripe dashboard you can accept online payments in a matter of minutes by sending invoices to your customers I hope this can be useful to for you in the current situation we've also compiled a list of kovat 19 resources for all stripe users which is linked in the description below stay safe and healthy everyone and see you next time [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'YftvRXupgpw', 'title':

'length': 544, 'author': 'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] as you begin the journey of implementing a stripe integration we want to arm you with a really powerful tool that will help you build test and manage your integration so enter the star of today's show the stripe CLI or the stripe command-line interface it's a command-line utility for securely testing your web hooks tailing your API request logs creating updating and retrieving API objects and much more that really just speeds up the common tasks and workflows so the content in today's episode acts as a foundational reference point to other developer office hours episodes and so whether you're just getting started or a seasoned stripe integrator this is going to be a great place to jump in welcome back to stripe developer office hours I'm CJ developer support engineer here at stripe and the stripe CLI has become an invaluable part of my workflow I'm really excited to share it with you so let's take a quick look at the agenda for today so to begin we'll install and connect the stripe CLI to our account and then we'll look at some of the API resource commands and pair those with another command line tool called JQ and next we'll explore the web hook commands that allow us to listen for web hook events and also trigger those event notifications and then we'll wrap with just a lightning round of the quick winds and other utilities that are currently available as part of the stripe CLI so the first thing I wanted to do is jump over to the wiki page for the stripes Eli's github and show you this this installation Docs this is where we're really going to start start going here or get going so for Mac you can use a homebrew to install for Linux you know for various distributions we have some installation instructions here and we also have a couple of ways you can install with Windows or as a docker image so since I'm on a Mac I'm gonna use this brew install command and I'm using I term today but really you can use any terminal that doesn't matter if you're on a Mac and you're really just sort of getting started you can use command space to open up the spotlight or Alfred finders and then type terminal or type I term to open up this window okay so I'm just gonna paste in the brew install command and this is going to install the stripe see alive this is going to be our command-line utility and as soon as the stripe CLI is installed there are some things that we can do so the very first thing I want to do is just try to type stripe and that'll show me all the commands that I'm that are available to run and kind of the way that we use the stripe command so the way that the way this works is we type stripe and then a space and then our command so some of the webhook commands listen and trigger we'll get to those later some stripe commands we can do log tailing and look at the status of stripe so maybe we want to just check the version of stripe CLI that's installed we can say stripe - V note that this one point 3.5 is the version of the stripe CLI that's not the version of your API so you'll want to look in the stripe dashboard for your API version which is usually looks like a date year-month-day separated by hyphens so the other thing we can do here now is we can say stripe status and that'll tell us the status of the API it shows us that all services are online that's great now the next thing on our list is to connect the stripe CLI to our stripe account so when we have access to a browser so in in this environment I can open a browser and successfully authenticate you can say stripe login so we say stripe login and hit enter it shows us a pairing code so reform favored prized right we want to confirm that that matches when we get when we open the browser so we're gonna hit enter to open the browser and then we are shown our pairing code and we can pick which account which of our stripe accounts that we want to use with this with this authentication of the stripe CLI and so I'm gonna say yep that pairing code looks right so I'm going to allow access and we're done so I can just close that tab and go back to the go back to the CLI I'm sorry back to the terminal one thing worth noting too is that you have to be logged into your stripe dashboard in your default browser before you hit open or otherwise you'll have to login for that to work which is totally another valid path ok so now that we've logged in we have access to all of our stripe data directly in the command line so we can say things like stripe plans list and that will list the plans for the stripe account that we just authenticated with so that's pretty cool the way that this works is there are some special keys that are stored in the config so we can look at stripe config dash dash list and that shows us the stripe keys that were created just for this specific setup so our default account is the one that we just authenticated - that's our like demo account what if you wanted to or maybe sometimes you'll have multiple stripe accounts maybe once for test once for production maybe have like a CI account so if you if you need to manage and kind of jump between those different accounts you can use the project name so we can say stripe login - - project project names CI for example to create another config so now we have a new pairing code we hit enter and then when we're we're prompted here we can select the other account so maybe this is the CI account that we want to authenticate with so glitz well that matches our our pairing code that we were just shown so we'll allow access and connect and so we're done here again and go back to the terminal and now if we were if we say stripe config - - list we'll see that we have both a default and a CI config it's pretty handy so if if you are in an environment where you don't have access to a browser and you can't pop that open for example if you're running this on like a CI machine or something that doesn't have access to a browser you can use the config set command so you can say stripe config - - set and then maybe you want to set your live mode API key to something like SK test xxx or SK live in this case and what that will do is just it'll set the key for you so you can go to your stripe dashboard grab some keys that you need to use for C and then use stripe config set as part of maybe your build process and that will that will set your key so we can look again stripe config list to list out our config and you'll see that this has been this has been updated cool so that's really how you get connected with the stripe CLI let's move on to part 2 API resources so you have full access to make API requests to your stripe account directly with the CLI so what I think might make sense is let's try to create a customer and then subscribe that customer to a plan all from the CLI so one thing you might want to know is like what are the resources that are available so we if we say stripe resources that will list out all the different resources that you can access pretty handy so we find customers in here that's great so we can say stripe customers what does that do okay well stripe customers takes an operation and here's the different operations that we can use create delete delete a discount list retrieve update and then some parameters okay cool so what if we say stripe customers create and maybe if we add the - - help flag that'll give us some more information about what we can pass so here in the request parameters these are just like some of the params that we can pass so if we say stripe customers create - - balance or - - coupon we can pass in arguments that are used to create that customer so another thing though that that I want to do is in order for a stripe customer to have like a payment method that's used when they are billed for stripe billing with a subscription they have to have like an invoice settings default payment method which isn't in the list of like default request parameters and so if I'm not if I'm not like a hundred percent sure what options are available to pass to that customer I can say stripe open API and that will open up the API Doc's for you know the AP the full api reference so then once I'm here I can search for customers and go to create customer and I see all the arguments that I can pass in to create a customer which is is pretty neat so we have the payment method that'll be important because we want to attach a payment method that we're going to use for billing and then down here under invoice settings we have the invoice settings default payment method so this is a nested argument so I want to show you both how to send those like top level requests args and then also some nested ones another thing to point out while we're here in the API ref is that stripe CLI is one of the like language options that you can use from the drop-down to see what the format of the request might look like so maybe for your integration if you're building in Ruby this is the code that you would use to create a customer with a description and with the stripe CLI it looks just like this so stripe customers create - - description and a description okay so let's head back over to the terminal and we'll say stripe customers create and we'll give this this customer and email and it'll be just like CLI test example comm and let's also give them a payment method which is p.m. Card Visa so this payment method right here is going to be the token of the payment method that you tokenized on the client with stripe GS or stripe iOS or stripe Android but when you're in test mode you can use these test tokens so one of what while you're looking at the test cards in the docs you'll see these four two four two numbers which are really common but then these in these other tabs you have options to use these shortcut tokens that are pre-built in order to test different scenarios for you so I'm just gonna use this p.m. card visa as sort of the the card that we're going to use on this customer so bypassing the payment method at the top level I'm attaching the payment method to the customer and then I also wanted to pass this nested invoice settings because it's nested you can't really use like the the - - argument for the request argh so we have to say - D and then I can say invoice settings default payment method like this because the default payment method is nested inside of the invoice settings argument so it's kind of like an attribute style the same way that you would see with curl or with like a query string parameter and I can again pass p.m. card visa so now this is actually going to create a customer through the API and we get back the data at the JSON data for that newly created customer we have this ID we have this customer ID which is great so the next thing we can do is we can say like stripe customers retrieve and then pass in that customer ID we get back the same data super handy so the next thing I want to do is create a subscription now that we have a customer they have payment methods they have a payment method set and they have their invoice settings default payment method set that's great so now we can say stripe subscriptions create and again if we do - - help that'll tell us all the different things that we can pass in when creating a subscription so tons of different options for creating subscriptions for now I just need customer and then I need to tell it like which plan to subscribe to so I'm gonna say stripe customer oops we lost our ID here let's go grab that customer ID and oops subscriptions stripe subscriptions create customer and then we also want to say dash D items so this is how we set the plan plan equals and then I have a I have a plan with the ID movies setup in here so I can say create a subscription for this new customer with the plan movies and look at that I've got a new active subscription I've charged the customer and it's successfully up and running and this is so cool I love that you can do everything directly from the command line it's so neat so now we have this latest invoice so we something we might do just grab that ID and say you know like stripe invoices retrieve and then pass in the invoice ID Justice a is the status of that invoice paid and it is so that's super handy way to kind of just like poke around and explore we've created a customer we subscribed them to a plan and so this is this is one of the examples that you can go through to like interact with those resources directly through the API with the stripe CLI so you can kind of think of the CLI as a command line interface in your dashboard as a graphical user interface that are really helpful when trying to determine what what things you're building for your integration ok the next thing I want to show is that not all of the API endpoints are accessible with your restricted keys that come with the CLI for instance if you have connected accounts so if you're a platform and you're debugging with connected accounts and you try to say something like stripe accounts list you'll receive this error that says the provided key arcade test blah blah blah does not have the required permission for this endpoint so in this case what I like to do is pass in my key explicitly with - - API key and then I store my my secret key which is not the restricted key but the secret key I stored in an environment variable because I'm doing this a lot but you could pass in your secret key right here directly and that would use your secret key instead of the restricted key and here we get all of the connected account data back so that's pretty neat ok so that's how you can pass sort of an API key if you're restricted key doesn't have enough permission ok the next thing I want to do is show you how to pair this with JQ so what is JQ j q is a command line tool sort of like said but for processing json directly in the command line very handy and because the output of a lot of these API resource operations is is JSON data we can interact with that json data directly with JQ so if we say something like stripe customers list maybe maybe our goal is to create like a CSV file of the stripe ID for a customer and their name and email for it for instance so if we say stripe customer list - JQ it's a whole bunch of methods that you can call with JQ and I'd point you to the documentation here so this is this is like the the docs for JQ really really powerful stuff highly recommend highly recommend it so if we take stripe customers list and we pipe it into JQ and we say dot or maybe keys that'll tell us what the keys are in the JSON object that was passed to JQ so there's data has more object and URL so in this case we want to look at data and we know that data is in in an array and we want to pull out the IDS of all the different customers so now we have you know just like a list of customer IDs that's pretty neat JQ you can also like pass JQ lists of or like these long expressions where you can compose different pieces together so we can say dot ID dot name email and then maybe we pipe that to at CSV as part of JQ to create a CSV file that has the stripe ID the name and the email of the customers directly in our account hey maybe we want a few more of those we can say - - limit 100 that's like the maximum so let's let's get the 100 customers here and you see their names and emails directly as a CSV really powerful stuff and pairing the stripe CLI with JQ definitely improves my workflow on the day to day so I wanted to wanted to share that and point that out okay I think that's that's the end of part two let's move on to Act three of today's show which is how to use the stripe CLI with web hooks so oftentimes when you are building a third party integration that uses web hooks you might set up some sort of tunneling software third party tunneling software so that you can provide a public URL to which third party can send post requests that you can then you know test your local webhook server so you want to tunnel from some public domain to your local machine to receive requests but that's like it's kind of tough to get everything all set up and configured so the stripe CLI makes this incredibly simple there is a command called listen and so you can say stripe listen and the stripe listen command is going to establish a direct connection from stripe to your computer and allow stripe to deliver webhook event notifications directly to your machine through through the stripe listen which is it's incredibly powerful and you avoid having to use any third-party tools in order to tunnel the requests from stripe to your to your local development machine now in production you'll have to go set up a real web hook Handler and test it out and test that your public domain is actually available and receiving these post requests from stripe but in development you can use stripe listen to have those events forwarded directly to your local machine now when you're using stripe listen with the stripe CLI you don't actually need to configure any web hook endpoint on in your stripe dashboard or with the API so by by saying stripe listen the CLI is going to configure a web hook endpoint for you inside the dashboard that will forward those those web hook events directly to your machine really cool really powerful stuff so yeah so this is how it works you can just say let's see stripe listen okay and so now stripe is listening for events to happen on our on our stripe account here you see the web hooks secret so if your web hook endpoint handler is doing signature authentic our signature verification you can use this web hook secret to verify those signatures and test your signature verification locally so right now it's just kind of like open waiting for some event to happen so the the first way we can trigger an event to happen or make it making it and it's just by creating some object in the API that will cause an event to happen also while we're here let me show you a bunch of different event types or the where to find the list of event types so if you head back over to the API refugee also do stripe open API and you go to types of events here there's a huge list account dot updated and then this massive massive list customer subscription pending update expired file created invoice that updated so these are all the event types the event types are usually this like dot delimited thing with the object type and then some action that's taken on it very long list so that's where you might find the different types of events so if we wanted to trigger an event one thing that we could do is just make the API call that will cause that event to be fired so if we want a customer dot created event to happen we might just say stripe customers create and that will create a customer and result in a customer dot created event happening and here's the event ID pretty cool sometimes it's difficult to set up all the different API requests you need in order to to trigger a specific event for instance the checkout session completed event is particularly difficult to - to trigger directly from the CLI to automate because there's a couple of different things that need to happen in there you have to have the customer has to go to checkout they have to attach their payment method a customer is created payment intent is created and then succeeded and then a charge succeed then finally the payment intent or the the checkout session completed event fires so in those cases where it's where it can be really difficult to to fire or to test triggering a specific event there are a handful that have already been pre implemented for you as part of the stripe CLI and that is exposed through the trigger command so we can say stripe a trigger and then pass trigger a list or I'm sorry pass trigger the event type that we want to fire so here in the supported events there's a big list and one that I want to show is checkout session completed so if we say stripe trigger checkout session completed event then a whole number of API requests are being made in order to result in this checkout session completed so we see a payment intent was created and then a payment intent is going to succeed will have a charge created and customer created a number of different things so here we have like a whole bunch of events that are firing just so that we can get that checkout session completed event to fire super handy so you kind of just say stripe trigger checkout session completed and then then you can you know you'll you'll see that event mm-hm be published to your your listener here okay one other thing that we can do is we can say stripe listen stripe listen - - events to pass specific event types that we want to listen for so maybe we want to fire up this listener but we don't want to receive all of the firehose of events that are happening on our account so maybe we really only want to listen to checkout session completed and payment intent succeeded or something so we can say stripe - - events and pass in the list of event types to filter down to just those event types that we want to listen to so I'm going to refire the checkout session completed event down here and we'll see that just those two events are displayed so we're kind just like filtering out which events we want to listen to so we get the payment intent succeeded and then we get the checkout session completed event and again these the events that we're listening to are coming from stripe so the stripe trigger command is making API requests to stripe that is creating the objects and when those objects are created and actions are taken the result in events that are being published and those notifications for the events are being published to our account and the account inside of stripe sees that we have a stripe CLI listen listener hooked up and so those event notifications are being delivered directly to our local machine really really cool really handy stuff now the one thing that we haven't done yet is passed this to a local but one more thing before we do that I wanted to show you if you if you add on the dash J this is kind of handy too you can you can output all of the JSON data for an event so if you have if you tack on dash J that'll print out a JSON for the incoming thing so by default also the stripe listen is going to receive events with the the API version which is the default API version of your account so they'll be formatted as the as the data for your your API or for your accounts default API version you can also pass dash L if you want the events in the latest version of the API but you can't specify like a specific API version just like your default accounts API version or the latest and that's that's it so here we get yeah like the in the in the log for our stripe listen we see the JSON output for the events that were published to our endpoint which is super cool super handy okay moving on so this is great we're having events delivered to our local machine but I I'm a web developer and I'm implementing a web hook Handler and I want to know what my web hook endpoint is doing so how can I use the stripe CLI to test my web hook handler so the way this works is we forward we can forward those events that are happening to a local web hook server so I have a web server here that I'm going to fire up and this is gonna be a look this is a local server it's a rail server it's listening on localhost 3000 and so when I say stripe listen I can forward to localhost 3000 slash web hooks this is like the local path to my local server that I want to have those web hooks the web hook notifications published too so we've got our our web hook listener let's again trigger checkout session completed and so we see the payment intent created happened and we got a 200 back from our local - our local webhook server if we go over here we can see in the server log that those post requests are coming in which is pretty neat so we got one post request and then we should get a flood of a bunch more as we receive those other events that happen and then finally we handle this checkout session completed event so that's pretty neat you can you can set up your local your local server with its web hook handler to listen for those events and then receive those a couple a couple other things to add about events and web hooks before we move on and that is these are the IDs of the events so EVT underscore that's the event that just fire this is this check out session check out session completed event and what you can do is one of the API resources that's that's available is the the events resource so we can say stripe events retrieve and we can pass in that event ID okay that's cool we got back all the all the data for that event that's great but let's say that for some reason we our web hook handler had a bug and it failed to process this specific event and what we really want to do is just reprocess the event what you can do is you can say stripe events resend with that specific ID for the event ID and when you hit enter it will retry that event and refire it to your server so that's that's really powerful super fun and something I really wanted to share ok so that that's how you use the stripe CLI to work with web hooks so there's still a couple more things that I wanted to show you trying to make it trying to make it quick okay so stripe serve is a tool for setting up quickly a local file server so let's say you have just like a basic HTML page just want to say like maybe we have like an h1 that says hi stripe integrators okay then we can we can say stripe serve and that will create a local static file server that you can then use to to test your local static files super handy there's a number of different ways you can set up static servers and and things but it just comes for free with stripe CLI which is so nice okay another really cool one that I wanted to share is stripe samples so you can say stripe samples and there's a couple commands here so a stripe sample is a github repository and a collection of code examples for that demonstrate how to integrate some of our products and so there's repositories up on github that you can explore and they generally come with a client directory and a server directory and the server's support generally many different languages so Ruby Python PHP go and so one thing that you can do with stripe samples is directly from the stripe CLI you can pull down a stripe sample and auto have it auto configure your your API keys this is so cool so we can say stripe samples list and this will tell us all the different stripe samples that are available right now so we can we can just go through here and say like oh we can learn how to accept basic card payment that's cool accept a card maybe this set up subscriptions one looks good so I'm gonna say stripe samples create and then pass in stripe samples create and then pass in the name of that stripe sample and that's gonna download and say what which server do you want to use like what is your back-end language Java anode Python Ruby I think I'm feeling like ruby is a good good option today so we have now this new set up subscriptions directory and in here I can just jump right into server and say Ruby server and yeah that fires up another local host for two for two and I can refresh the page and hey look at that I've already caught a stripe sample up and running in like two seconds so you can explore the code that is behind this - right like you can if we jump back over here you can say what does that server look like how is it implemented this is the Ruby code that's backing that server very cool stuff okay so that's stripe samples yeah as a quick recap we covered how to install and configure the CLI how to connect it to your stripe account and use the config command to set API keys if you're if you're using the CLI outside of an environment that has a browser we also showed you how to interact with API objects and create update finally we showed you stripe serve and some stripe samples a couple things we didn't cover that I think are worth mentioning if you just say stripe here and then start playing around with some of these commands completion will allow you to or it generates like the bash completion command so you may have seen I said stripe cuts are like see you and then I hit tab and that'll autocomplete to customers and then I can say re and that'll autocomplete to retrieve so bash completion will help you there it's pretty neat logs log tailing we didn't cover that so that's that's helpful for looking at the logs as they're as they're happening on your account the fixtures command this is like a really advanced version of trigger so you can implement your fixtures as JSON documents that can be a series of API requests that you want to make so you can kind of like build a custom trigger command that can automate a number of different API requests in sequence for you we talked about samples open is you know again to open those quick links in the docs and feedback is a great way for you to tell us what you think about the CLI how we can improve we're we're we're yeah what we're we might be able to to make make this this useful tool even more useful so those are a couple things we did not cover in depth I really hope this was this was useful for you and again this is really just a foundational tool something that's really important that I really want you to know is that you are not alone in building your integration we are here with you and right by your side and we'd be more than happy to help chat chat through any questions you have about your integration or best practices come come hang out with us on IRC we're in the freenode stripe channel otherwise if you wanted to reach out and get assistance for a non-technical question you can always reach out to support stripe comm that's a great Avenue yeah so until next time Cheers you\", metadata={'source': 'Psq5N5C-FGo', 'title': 'Introduction to the Stripe CLI', 'description':

Document(page_content=\"today we're excited to demo how creating cards through the API can be just as effortless as accepting them with stripe welcome back to stripe developer office hours I'm CJ developer support engineer and as a reminder we have knowledgeable stripes that are standing by in chat ready to answer your questions so ask away stripe issuing is an API for creating credit cards and it really is enabling new business models stripe issuing it's like it's an end-to-end platform for quickly like creating and distributing and managing virtual cards but also physical cards and these are allow you to do things like create like a employee expense cards with dynamic spending limits or generate virtual cards that your marketplace couriers can pay with their phones at specific merchants so you might create a virtual card and then use a push API to send that virtual card directly to your couriers phone and they can walk into a merchant and pay directly with that virtual card which is really really exciting and you know traditionally card issuance has involved tons of dev time and there's all these requirements and long-term contracts and lots of fees that are up front but with stripe issuing a lot of that complexity is abstracted away so you can start creating cards faster and scale more efficiently so stripe issuing right now is still us only and invite-only so if you wanted to get an invite head over to stripe issuing stripe calm slash issuing and then scroll to the bottom and you can fill out this form to request access to the beta this is really just kind of a fun end of end of the year episode where we wanted to show you how you might quickly get up and running to take payments I'm sorry to create cards with stripe issuing so today what we're going to do is we're going to use the API and we're going to build a quick rails app and we're going to create card holders and cards we're going to handle authorizations with a web hook Handler and then we're gonna list transactions and I'll show you what all of that looks like and so this is what kind of the final product will look like we'll have a list of card holders and right now this is just their IDs and you can click on a card holder and see like the just the raw JSON output of that card holder and you can see links to all the different cards so we'll say create card it'll generate another card for us and here's kind of just the ID of the card but we can drill in and we can see the virtual card number directly and we can see you know the expiration dates and the CBC's for those cards we can also see all the details about about the cards directly here in the JSON that's included so we see that it's a virtual card and then it's active and so this today and then we'll demonstrate you know that you can take this card number and go use it in a checkout process so that's what we're gonna build today and we're really excited to get started so let's head over to to the console here and jump right in so just completely remove that demo that we were watching just now and start completely fresh okay so rails new issuing demo I'm gonna skip tests and I'm gonna skip get and while this is firing up I'm gonna go grab my API key because I will need to enter that into my stripe credentials here so rails is still firing up all of its new front-end special front-end things and while that is going we will get started here so you can actually create cards and card holders directly through the dashboard we're not going to show that today because you know it's really just kind of like in the UI and you can you can easily do that what I wanted to show you is how exciting and how quick it is to set up issuing with just a few lines of code so the first thing I want to do is edit my credentials and I'm gonna enter the stripe key here the clipboard and then the next thing I'm going to do is update my gem file and that will install the stripe ruby gem which we're going to use to interact with the stripe API today okay and then for this demo I'm not actually going to save anything to the database at all we're just gonna directly use the API to fetch the data that we're going to display on the screen there's one other piece of what other change that you'll need to make in your dashboard before you are able to use issuing that is to switch to manual payouts so from your dashboard settings here I'll show you back in the browser yeah so from your dashboard settings you'll go into settings and then bank accounts and scheduling and select manual here the the next thing that you'll need to do is add some money to you or bank account I'm sorry to your stripe accountant so one way that you can do that in tests is to create a charge so I'm using the stripe CLI here and we'll add a link to that in in the description and you can kind of see this a little bit so I am using the stripe see all I'm saying striped charges create I'm passing the source let's see I'm passing the source token by pass if you pass the source toke bypass pending that will bypass the the the pending window where a charge is pending before it hits your balance so this when you create this charge it will immediately be available and your balance and you'll be able to use those funds for testing out stripe issuing by using those funds to spend money on issued cards so first thing they need to do is update your payouts to manual the second thing you need to do is add some funds to your balance by creating some charges with this toke bypass pending now in practice as charges are happening through maybe another form of business you're adding those those funds directly to your stripe account from money that you're collecting from customers then you can turn around and issue cards that can draw money from those balances so okay so we have we have created a big charge here with a thousand dollars USD and that is bypassing pending we'll just make a couple of those so we have plenty of funds here in our and our balance that we can use with our freshly issued issued cards okay so the next step that I want to do is I actually just want to generate a couple of controllers that we're going to use to show things on the page and then we'll update our routes so the first controller is going to be a card holders controller and that'll have the index the index page for card holders will just be kind of like the route route for the entire application we're just gonna show a list of the card holders that we have in our stripe account we also want to wait to create new card holders and to show card holders so I will create the card holders controller with each of those views so index new and show and then I will create another controller for cards and finally a controller for webhooks because we want to build a web hook handler that will be able to process incoming web hooks for authorization requests and those authorization requests will be either approved or declined in our web hook Handler I'm not sure where that is hanging sometimes for some reason spring causes issues so let's try that again rails generate controller card holders index and let's see okay there we go so that created the the three views that we're looking for okay the next controller will create is one four cards and this will just need a show for now I think and that should be good and finally we'll create a web hooks controller and that's just gonna have a create action so we have no view for it we're just gonna render back some JSON when we receive a post request from stripe and we have a whole episode about web hooks and so we'll link to it above and okay so let's see so I'm going to now jump into my routes and just define some of these so root is gonna go to card holders index and then I'm gonna have holders and resource cards web links the first one we're gonna work on is our card holders controller and in the index we're gonna create an instance variable called card holders that will have the list of card holders and we're gonna fetch those again directly from the API so here just gonna say stripe issuing card holder list okay and that should give us back a list of card holders and foreshow will say stripe issuing a card holder dot retrieve and so for the show route it's gonna look something like this it'll be like card holders slash and then we're gonna have the ID of the card holder here so I forget what that actually looks like so it's I CH and then a random string and this i CH is going to be the stripe ID the stripe token for the card holder so that'll be passed to us as params ID so we're just going to take that params ID and forward it on to the retrieve method of card holder and and get back the the card holder instance from the API that is exposed through the stripe Ruby Jim as in class a card called a cardholder class that we can access methods on so also with the cardholder show page I want to show the list of cards for that cardholder so I'm going to say at cards here I'm going to say card that lists and pass in cardholder and pass the ID of that card folder so we're going to get back in this case a list of all the cards that we have issued to that cardholder now okay I think we're getting pretty close we also want to make a create method here for creating a new card holder and before I go too far what I want to do is show you the stripe guide that I'm gonna follow here so if you got a straight comm slash Docs you'll find the issuing section of the docs on the left-hand nav and we're gonna go through the section called issuing cards and really there's just two steps creating the card holder and creating the card for that card holder so the step for creating the card holder here looks like this we're going to copy this code and paste it in our create action for creating a card holder you'll notice that it takes in email and phone number status and whether it's an individual or a business and then also the billing address that is really kind of like all you need the more information you pass the better because we're gonna run or stripe is going to run through some fraud checks against that that name just to make sure that you know we're following the regulatory and legal guidelines regarding issuing cards to card holders so the more information that you can collect the better as part of you know making sure that folks aren't making fraudulent purchases etc so again I'm just gonna copy that jump back over to the code here and paste that in so we're gonna create a card holder and the name that we're gonna receive is I'm actually gonna pass in first name and last name separately params email same with on the status is going to be active and the tyke is going to be an individual for this demo we're not going to demo how to build a business it's alright I'm sorry how to do it with a business it's very similar so that's that's where we're gonna start it's just with an individual that is active okay let's pass here and we'll take in the address as line one and then we'll take in the city as Lam's City and the state and postal code just like that in the country I'm actually gonna leave the country just as US because right now we're only issuing in the US so the create action is gonna or we're gonna build a form that will accept the name email phone and address of our cardholder and when that form is submitted we're going to make a post request to this card holders controller passing all this information in here to create a cardholder then we're simply going to redirect to cardholder ID we're gonna redirect to the show page before that cardholder when we're done creating that through the API obviously you won't you'll want to wrap this in some error handling and support other cases and collection and verification or like data validation on your own end but really just trying to keep the demo simple so this is how we're going to create a cardholder okay so before we go too far when we fire up our rails server and make sure that that is actually working here okay so let's bring up the browser and if I go to localhost 3000 I see no API key provided set your API key like like so you can generate the keys from striped web interface so I've already got my my API key in the credentials but you know what I forgot to put it in the in an initializer striped RB something to fire up a new initializer here stripe the API key is rails the application dot credentials dig I'm passing in stripe and then I'm passing in secret key all right a little visitor here for a second ok so now we've set the API key and I'm saying rails server so I'm going to fire up the real server and now I'm gonna refresh the page in the browser so that is refreshing okay card holders index that's what the index page looks like and that is what we expect to see okay so let's go back to our code I'm just going to drop in so CSS but things look nice this is from some CSS from previous demos and then we can head over to ok that's really just a to make it look nice here so all right so our list of card holders is going to look something like this we'll have a ul and we'll have an Li that's going to print out linked to our leader dot ID or an older path or an older ID and again that's going to be the stripe ID so for each cardholder we're gonna iterate over and print out these allies that have nuts in them and that's really going to be kind of the extent of our client so this is what it looks like we're hitting the stripe API and fetching our card holders and bringing those back so let's we can add a little bit more detail here we can say put out the ID but also print out maybe print out the C so now if we go back to our browser you'll see the name is there with it so we have just like a little bit more information ok let's also add a link to create a new card holder holders ad card okay fresh we have this ad cardholder link okay so now let's go build our form for creating a new card holder it's gonna be in card holders new so we're gonna have the name now we're gonna have a first name first and then I think we want like the address information so we'll say line one and city postal code okay we're gonna we're hard-coding the country but otherwise you you might accept the country there okay so let's go back to our browser and refresh and now we have this full input where we can populate this with information about our cardholder we'll call it now Jenny demo instead of Jenny frozen and then when we click create card holder that should send a post request to our server and it is now we're getting not a valid phone number that's because we did not put in a phone number there let's actually leave out the phone number completely okay for now because we're not actually validating the phone number we're gonna we're gonna remove that okay an initialized constant stripe issuing car whole er I misspelled card over there so pull back up the card holders controller here we're going to skip over phone number for now and this needs to be create cardholder fantastic so now we have a new ID card holder okay sorry that's let me show you what that looks like okay so Jenny demo to demo to create card holder and you'll notice that we have a new card holder ID here in the browser that we can use and that's going to be params ID for card holders show so now we can fetch the card holder or we've already fetched the card holder and now which one implement the show page here we're going to print out all the data of the cardholder list the cards and allow creating new cards so if we go to cardholder show and here actually inside of that tag we can print out the card holders name and down here I'm gonna make a pre tag it's just gonna hold the JSON the output of the cardholder that we received back just so that we can see kind of like the all the output of the cardholder and then I also want to show like the cards the list of cards here so I'm gonna say let's make another UL ID card path okay so let's see what that looks like over here and refresh card holder dot name for nill class so back to our code let's go back to our controller and make sure we are fetching the card holder as expected get back to the browser I had a misspelled the instance variable name there okay so now we see Jenny demo too and we see cards which is just a no there's actually no cards yet but there will be a list of cards here shortly as soon as we create a card so now I'm gonna add just like a big button here that says create card and we're gonna generate a brand new card for that card holder and that is the step two in this guide create a card so I'm gonna copy this for later and you'll notice that we're gonna create a virtual card but if you're gonna create a physical card you want to set the shipping address where the the physical card should be sent to so here we're gonna we're gonna create a card the other thing that we need to do too is eventually activate the cards you can you can set the card to active by default when you create it and that's not here included directly in this this demo snippet so instead you can it says when you create the card you can set the status to active so we're going to pass it status active so that our cards are active right off the bat just like our card holders so if we go back here let's go back to the code that is all looking good go to our cards controller make a new card and set the status to active and then we will redirect back and the thing that we want to pass here is the ID of the card holder so our cards controller is quite simple it has a create actions is going to receive the post request with the data including our our card holder that we're going to use to create this new card that we're gonna issue to that card holder and when we go to the card show page we want to show details about the card so we're gonna show you know the credit card number it's expiration and the CBC which we can retrieve from the API using the special details endpoint for the stripe issuing card API so that you can either call retrieve here with the card ID or you can call details when you call retrieve that retrieves all of the non sensitive details of the card so you can see last for the ID of the card expiration I'm actually not sure if you can see expiration but you can see last for things like that with details when you pass the ID of the card to details you're gonna get the full details of that virtual card so this is a little bit gonna be a little bit more careful when calling card details because you're getting back the real details of the car so this is this is really sensitive here on our show page we're gonna just like print the card all the card details so that we can use it as part of demoing through checkout but it's something that you want to take into consideration as you're implementing this I'm just gonna fetch the entire card and then the other thing I want to add here is the transactions so for each card that you issue every time that it's used there will be a new transaction that is logged for that card and those transactions you can fetch the list of those transactions associated with that card by passing the ID of the card to this stripe issuing transaction a API endpoint okay let's head over to our let's go back to our cardholder bill page and let's make a button here that will it's actually going to be a an entire form but it'll look just like the button to create card so we're gonna send a post request with a hidden input that has the cardholder so when we're on the cardholder show page that would just be a button that says create card and we're gonna create a virtual card that is already active and is assigned to that cardholder and then we'll see it added to the list of cards for that cardholder okay great so let's let's go back to the browser and see what this looks like so we head back over here we go back to her okay so we have this giant button now for creating a card so go click click create card and there it is so now we have we have a new card if we click on on that card we'll see the card show page for that we haven't implemented this yet but we'll dig in and show you how that should look okay so I'm gonna go back to our code and here under cards show when I wanted to demonstrate is showing the first thing I want to do is just show you that you can see the card number expiration in CBC and all that and we can just print it out and show that directly to the user here again sensitive information you want to be careful with this for demo purposes I'm going to show you that we can just put it on the page be easy to copy and paste and walk through the checkout flow okay so we want to do this yeah sure so we're gonna say card number and at card number let's see the expiration okay and then similar to the others we'll just put the the full free or the full JSON in a little pre here just so we can see the raw data of the card that is retrieved when you call details when you use the details endpoint from the API okay so I don't go to the browser refresh our page and here we see this is the brand-new card that was created it has this this card number in this expiration and the CBC this is a test card it's in live mode false but we do see that it is a real card so what I want to do now is I have a little check out a little check out implementation here that is using the same account the same demo account so I'm going to copy that card number I'm gonna walk through checkout to buy some pins with this card that we just created so I'm going to enter in that card number the expiration is 1122 the CBC is 1 2 3 test customer 8 9 4 3 6 whatever okay and then we're gonna click pay and right now there are no there's no authorization request webhook setup so the authorization request is going to run through the rules that we have set in our dashboard and right now I don't have any rules set up for issuing in my dashboard so we see this is Jenny demo 2 this is the card that we just issued to Jenny demo 2 then we're gonna attempt to use and there are no authorization control setup but we could we could add those if we wanted so you can just click Edit and then you can add specific categories that are allowed or you can add spending limits per category per month very very handy little controls that you can do directly from the dashboard and you'll notice that these categories are the MCC codes just like built directly into the - bored which is pretty nice so right now we don't have any restrictions so when I click pay because they don't have a web hook set up and I don't have any restrictions this should just go through successfully and it did ok so we saw that successful successfully process we'll go back to the dashboard here refresh the paid the page here for Jenny demo and you'll see at the bottom there is this transaction for nine dollars and our merchant is this demo merchant with that card that we just issued so that's pretty exciting let's head back over to our page and if we refresh this oh right okay so the next step that I wanted to do is add the list of transactions here below that line jump back over to our code and show ya so let's say actions sorry step back table TR the head is going to be ID you were gonna have the amount that was paid and then let's just show like the merchant okay and then merchant data is going to be where the name of the merchant lives so for each of the transactions and the list of transactions that we've just fetched from the API in our controller action we're going to print out those results here let's go back to the browser and refresh and see if that worked okay I said transactions actions okay cool and now we see that that one transaction there so that is super exciting we've already processed the payment and here we are you know just a few minutes in we have we're creating card holders we're creating virtual cards we're accepting payments with those virtual cards so really cool stuff already so that is that is the first step of our agenda we want to create card holders and create cards we've actually used our virtual card already to process a payment one other thing that I wanted to point out before we get too far is underneath the issuing docs if you go down to I believe it's managing cards where is it here issuing cards I want to make sure that oh yeah okay so under digital wallets we give you instructions for how to provision cards so you can create a virtual card through stripe issuing and then you can add it directly to Apple Wallet or to to Google pay and so we have some instructions here for how you might set that up very cool stuff essentially you can have a process where you're issuing virtual cards to your couriers sending that card directly to their phone they don't even see the card number and then they can use the card and cut you know go to the merchant pay for for some service that is maybe connected to your business in some way so the process is maybe you have like a food delivery service and you can have a driver or you know the courier sign up for your food delivery service and you can issue them a card that only works at the merchant where they are supposed to collect or to pick up the food that needs to be delivered and you can use the funds that the that the the person buying the food sent you directly through your strife account so it's really really exciting stuff so I wanted to talk just to point out that we have guides on how to use iOS in Android provisioning to push those card details directly to those digital wallets so that's pretty pretty handy and pretty exciting stuff okay so the next step in in the process here is I wanted to show you how we can build a web hook handler that will receive a post request when the card is is used and that post request will tell us some information about the authorization that's being requested and at that point we can decide whether or not we want to approve or decline that authorization so okay so we're going to do this in our web hook Handler okay so let's go controller okay well hooks controller again we have a whole episode about web hooks the thing that's unique about authorization web hooks is that you can only have one web hook endpoint that is listening for issuing authorization requests and the reason is that we need one source of truth that is deciding whether or not you approve or decline this transaction so that is a that is a little bit nuanced but the the web hook endpoint that you want to listen for is issuing authorization dot request and so we're going to show just how to do that and this is you know in place of setting up those controls directly in your dashboard which you can totally do instead of building a web hook handler if that if that's how you wanted to go so in our web hook handler we need to first skip the CSRF check because we're receiving the post request directly from stripe here and give me more than I wanted okay so in this create method what we're going to do is we're gonna fire up an event that is stripe events from json.parse so this is just gonna like create an event object we're not doing any signature verification obviously you you'll want to go through that web hooks episode in the web hooks best practices there are a number of guides on on stripe about how to about how to handle all of all the best practices and how to handle web hooks signing and verification today we're just going to take the shortcut and construct the event and then handle just the authorization request here so event case on CA the case dot type when it is make sure I get this right issuing authorization at request okay so here this is the point where we need to decide whether we're going to approve or decline the authorization request so approve and/or decline so to demo this what I want to do is I'm gonna say if so the the authorization is going to be stored inside of event data object and if the authorization let's see what is that called if the authorization is pending authorized amount is less than or equal to $50 then we'll approve it otherwise we'll decline it and the way that you approve is you pass the ID of the authorization you want to approve and the way you decline is the same but you're passing it to the decline method and then in addition to passing the ID you can pass other other options here the one I'm going to pass now is just some metadata maybe the reason why I approved this so less less than or equal to the 50s that's how you might do that similarly you can do the same thing with decline you can pass metadata that you might have maybe the reason in more than 50 okay so with previous episodes and with other products it's quite easy to test your webhook handler with the stripe CLI in this case we need a specific webhook endpoint that is listening for this specific event type so it's a little trickier to test with the CLI and I want to make sure that we show you how to test within grok so I actually already have an in grok server running and listening so what I need to do now is in rails I need to add hosts I need to add this in grok domain to the hosts that we want to support okay so we should be able to receive requests from there we need to restart that okay so end rock is a popular tool for forwarding requests that are to a public URL to your local machine so that you can test things so it creates a tunnel where you can then receive requests and so what we're gonna do is go to our stripe dashboard and set up a new a brand-new web hook handler that will pass our events for issuing authorization requests directly to our new and grok endpoint here and we're gonna send those to web books slash web hooks and we want to pick the specific event authorization request at the endpoint okay so now every time I try to charge that card I will be receiving a web hook notification - this - to my local my local host 3000 webhook handler that is being tunneled through and rock and those requests will will enter our web hook handler and either be approved or declined based on how much that item costs or how much that authorization was so let's let's give this a spin I think we need to okay we're gonna restart the real server come back over here to the browser and let's grab our card number again go through a check out okay this is a nine dollar item we expect this to pass okay hey alright it looks like that was successful let's go back to our console so it it looks like we did not receive any requests there so what is going on issuing authorization requests we're in test mode that is the web hook URL issuing authorization request and we restarted the server and okay let's just go back through this entire thing from the top and make sure that we are receiving okay so we're going to add a card holder and three create the cardholder create a card for Jenny demo three go over to that card we'll copy that card number click buy pins go through the process of buying pins and click Buy okay so now if we look at our console we see that we did receive this type issuing authorization request web pop notification and the browser we're back to our success URL so that successfully processed now if we look in the dashboard under issuing we can find that card holder and we can see that we have an authorization here which is successful and the reason metadata is here and we see that that went through successfully that's cool okay so now what I want to do is before we get too far let's go and edit our little test here and say the quantity now is 30 so now we want to buy 30 of those pins this should push push us beyond our limit okay so I'm gonna restart that little test server and go back to the browser and now let's go through this flow again with the same card and now we expect that this should get declined by our web hook handler because it is more than 50 dollars okay pay $90 processing and your card has been declined okay that's great so now if we go back to the dashboard refresh and view our cardholder we see this authorization and we see that it was declined if we drill in there we should see the reason being more than $50 that's the metadata that we passed and so that is how we can pass and set specific metadata and how we can build a web hook handler to process those authorization requests which is really neat because you can look at the merchant you can look at the specifics about the merchant and maybe you only want to allow transactions that happen at gas stations or maybe you only want to allow you know purchasing software or you can you can set dollar amounts for you know per month or per week per day really really exciting things that you can do because in your webhook handler you can decide the logic for approving or declining those issuing authorization requests which is pretty neat okay let me just check here right okay let's go back to the browser in make sure that now if we refresh the page great okay so we're seeing the transactions there that's fantastic okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to pause for a little bit of Q&A so if you have any questions please just drop those in the chat we'd be more than happy to to answer those if you haven't had your question already answered today yeah I think we'd be more than happy to answer those I know that we've had a couple of questions come in already and those look like we've been answering them directly in chat fantastic okay cool okay yeah you know I just really just wanted to say thanks again for joining us for this week's office hours your engagement in in the live chat and your questions are always great to see we hope you found this useful and exciting and if you're interested again you'll want to go out and grab an invite over there at stripe comm slash issuing and if you enjoyed this episode and you want to see other live demos and other stripe office hours we'd love for you to and turn on the notifications there with the Bell we also have a monthly newsletter that we're putting out called the dev digest which you can access and sign up for on most of the pages and the stripe Doc's if you scroll all the way to the bottom you'll see a place where you can enter your email and sign up for that and we promise not to spam to spam that email it's really just for the dev digest and it's a it's a great place where you can learn about new features invites to in-person workshops we talked about the API and the SDK and client library updates that we're doing and often share a lot of fun stuff like the the stripe CLI no additions that are happening to the stripe CLI we have some really cool new additions to our front-end libraries coming out soon and so we will be announcing those in the dev digest so if you sign up there that's the great the best place to stay in the know in the description below we'll have links if you want to go through this guide yourself on github we always share the code from these demos directly on github so you can go check that out and see what that feels like and you know we're always constantly trying to strive to improve these office hours and one of the ways that you can really help us is by submitting that form down below to provide your feedback and let us know you know what you thought of this episode and what you might like in other episodes you know and one of the thing that I'd love to see is if you have a chance just just leave a comment below and tell us what you might build with stripe issuing you know it's such a new exciting API that is so simple to create cards I'd love to hear what what business models you're thinking of and what what new ideas that that are going to come out of this is really exciting API so yeah I think with that I'm just gonna jump over here back to ya signing off all right have a good one we'll see you next time\", metadata={'source': 'knBWhYMqLds', 'title': 'Stripe Issuing', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 12009,

everyone you know how I'm gonna talk a bit more about the trouble of webhooks all the troubles I think I've seen with webhooks my name is Joanne - I'm a developer evangelist at a company called Twilio can I ask who here has heard of Tulio at all before that is almost everyone amazing in that case I probably won't need to tell you about it we do phone calls that's that's it right text messages video chat or three two factor authentication yeah we've got a bunch of stuff we love that European the Europe is putting in whole bunches of like multi-factor authentication stuff into payments cuz like yeah that's a great idea but we're not talking about that we're not talking about team back to litigation on multi-factor authentication today we can talk about web folks and we kind of covered what web book is I found another definition of it which was like it's a user-defined HTTP call back right because you go into the inter into the dashboard of Twilio or a stripe and you say I want you to call this URL I see you define it and that's it it's HTTP that's all we need to know and so the problem is and so and we all use it and we talked about this already everybody how do i poke somewhere along the lines so what's the trouble I always feel the trouble is with that discovery of a new tool or service you're now told as a developer we need to build something with communications or with payments and something like that and it's particularly difficult for us in Twilio because these web hooks actually work synchronously for us when you make a phone call to another when you generate a phone call with a trillion number to somebody else's phone you don't actually tell the thing what to do at that point you give it a URL and that URL to Leo calls makes the web hook to and says what do I do now this cause connected and at that point that's when you have to tell it I don't know fought it to this other person or ask it a question or play a song or something like that and so I always find like yeah if you're in your exploring that new API for that first time and and sure you found like the Tulio node library in this case for example and we've built ourselves a client and you're reading the documentation you know I all right cool I need to create a call and when I create a call I need a from number that makes sense no phone calls come from numbers we'll find out in the Tokyo thing later we've got a to number right that also makes sense and will be probably I'll put my number in there some point but then like the third required thing is this URL and then you look into it alright okay that makes sense that we have to find out what to do with the call next but I was in I was in I was in the node repple here or or you know Python Ruby whatever you you're exploring this with so then you have to like quit all of that yeah all right cool I'll start an Express application or whatever and and and you start the Express segregation you build an endpoint you've got this endpoint then how do you test that and we've we've been through a few of these right you you might throw initial things into the request bin which actually went offline it was a great tool but there's replacement requests bins out there now which you can pay for or post bin which is a free alternative which does work or ultra hook as you mentioned earlier there's another one we've mentioned on the Toyota docks actually called servio which is currently offline due to some sort of phishing scam apparently don't happen there and then there's tunnels n grok local tunnel is another one that I've used in the past we're big fans of and rocket Oreo because it does seem to just work the best and it's absolutely nothing super the fact is actually built by an X trillion as it happens it was kind of cool I didn't know that when I first started using it and Alan Shrieve who's behind is a great developer Shane he's no longer on you oh yeah like whatever let's just push the production that's that's well said I mean will right correct code the first time right I can see senior developers here this is the problem so what can we do about it this is this is what we've been thinking for the last 11 years Twitter turned 11 last week I can't believe it 11 years we're like okay web hooks have been like there from day one as as important so what do we do with this how do we make this better for developers and so here is a bit of a whistle-stop tour of all the ideas and things we've had and they're all pretty much to live I think which is terrifying really because the first one comes from almost that long ago as well as an experiment called twin le'ts which were little applicator that you could create URLs for and use it actually looks like this still looks like this probably look like this on day one it's wonderful because we've got in here the old toyota logo here on the head of who I like to think of as dr. Twilio which we're not allowed to use in any official marketing materials which I would love to look at him he's brilliant but yes so these are actually lose their little PHP applications the code is actually open source we just don't publish it which is an interesting version of open source you you can ask for it somebody has reason it's quite cool and and it would give you things like just just a URL which would forward a call to another number a URL which would sort out voicemail for you and email you a transcription of the of the voicemail itself all sorts of things like that down to an echo to emit which would echo any twimble you put into the URL so it's kind of it was a little dynamic but not that much surprising number of people use this especially since it still looks like this it was an experiment it's never going away but around the same time there are a bunch of early fans of everything's called tweaked or more something and this is because when you respond to a web book request in Twilio you have to respond with some XML that tells Taliah what to do and that it's called Flamel Twilio XML I guess it's a good thing Jason wasn't popular 11 years ago because twice on might have been even weird socially so around yet still 10 9 10 years ago a group of developers who are so big fans of Tullio were like hey we don't want to spin up an application every time we do this and maybe they haven't thought found to emotes and they made turbines or 12 in comm was the actual application which much like request bin or something like that could me give you a unique URL to use but you could actually paste in to a text area there some twirl which you want to return that was cool it would also tell you if it was valid or invalid according to this screenshot I was writing invalid two of the times which is nice to know and we like this so much that she eventually several years later we bought it we bought it off of them and then we integrated it into the Tullio console so I wanted to show you that just quickly right now this is the tutorial console I'm just gonna buy a number that we can use to play around with during this talk and show you how to on wins kind of work now as part of the thing so I'm just gonna grab this phone number my phone and that's the event today cool you'll buy that number and then we're going to set it with a twelve in because something in Jeanette something there we go cool now I own this number when we go to set it up we have all these options to configure it and I got to deal with messaging which is down the bottom there right now and so right now you have this option if a message comes in we can have a web hook but why you have a web hook when we could have a 12 win and not even worry about any kind of local development whatsoever and we can select from our existing normal bins but if it's the first time you're going there you can create one which is even nicer so if I just write myself a quick normal response which always starts with response and ends with response and because this is for messaging I can write a message I'm gonna you actually if you grab your phones and we need to text to this in a minute so I would like you to text in start thinking about it now your favorite emoji because this kind of shows off that we took the static thing and made it a little bit less static because you can put kind of mustache templates in there now and use any parameters that are in the and again this is telling me about my valid tour but you can use any parameters that sent in by the URL or request bodies so if I I've saved the twelve in I save the number and if he's now sent a message send a message to this number it does see +61 but we're all in Australia I assume so it's just zero or plus six one four eight eight eight send in your favorite emoji remember I want to know what they are oh four eight eight eight four one 6:7 - my favorite emoji is the two beers cheering emoji because I like that the Unicode Emporium said and now we've got one beer but what if we had two beers and I know I've got a response from that cool anybody else getting something back from that yes yes nice all right so it's working we got we configured a number and we never left a single webpage is amazing still writing I know favorite emoji is hard there's so many there's new ones now oh my goodness I'm gonna I'm gonna move on because I'll run out of time otherwise so that was cool but we looked at those like little template things right that's cool we can make it a little bit dynamic but this is not a full programming environment yet people want to do full applications with this and that pushed the teams to think about the whole server less thing which was quite exciting actually like the ability to kind of write and run code without having to worry about your servers just inside the the Twilio infrastructure and this kind of came out in 2004 in 2017 and Troyer functions was great because it instantly gave you a URL you had to do that I I had to sweet talk somebody on the team to get Phil got 12 Io nobody else is getting all those and then you just put your code your JavaScript right in here and it would save and deploy and run and that was pretty cool I think anyway I mean there's some downsides to this some people might say JavaScript and be unhappy about that I'm not some people might be that's fine and the other one is you have to write it inside this text area and that's a bit of a shame because that's not how we do our regular development at least that's not how I do it I don't tend to pop open a text area on a web page and start banging away you could install in the configure section you can install NPM modules and stuff in here but that's kind of where we went with that for now we'll come back to this because a different team was taking a different tack at the same time they're like what if you don't even have to know what a web hook is or code or anything like that and they built studio which is just a dragon predator allows you to build conversation flows and initially as a developer I was like you're you're sacking us all but no of course and what's nice about this is it does the the basics very well and then as you want to do custom stuff allows you to either there's a widget for making an HTTP request a widget for invoking one of those functions and so this allowed non-developers product managers other people on the team designers who want to design the flow and actually visualize and see it work with it and again you could if we went back to our number which is over here we can just choose a studio flow instead - but yeah I'm a developer so there's less interested in that and another tack our developer education team are responsible for our documentation and our kind of in-person training events and Talia who's never liked to do things kind of the regular way and so back in 2013 we ran a conference in San Francisco and alongside that the developer event ISM team at the time I was not part of it that's far too long ago but they ran a workshop which they called Twilio quest that was a bit fun it was a bit kind of game oriented but it was a once-off and it it fell over to not be dealt with again then we decided to do in-person workshops again at our conference and actually wanted to kind of expand these to be online as well and so the developer education team picked up this idea of 20 requests and made totally requests to which look like this much more fun a bit more exciting Twitter Quest is a game to find a platform or was twenty quest to is a game if I platform online for learning how to use Twilio and it looks a bit like this you made yourself a little character that's mine I don't know why it's got a mullet right now you can change that and apparently I picked that at one point I mean this is the one for me and you get a little you get XP you get to add stuff to your character and you as you complete missions this is great except of course we still come across the problem that every single time they need to make a web hook we end up with having to do any work and so one of the missions is set up any rock and what what was terrible about this was when we released this to the world not necessarily in person stuff but to the rest of the world there was a bit of a drop-off between people going through missions and in this getting started mission the biggest drop-off was when we got them to set up in Raqqa no I never tool no I'm done so the team went back to the drawing board they were not done with this Tullio quest 3 came out earlier this year which has an even cooler logo I think a little bit more metal actually I this is them this is my favorite so far I want to t-shirt with that on we haven't made them yet but I'm sure we'll get there Twilio Quest 3 they went all out it is a downloadable installable application with a full-on game inside it I can't just tell you about it I need to show you it it's right here this is my Twitter character but I'm going to turn the music on [Music] [Applause] [Music] now of course there is a because that's important especially if you go home operator I am pleased to see you once again [Music] building an entire development they run it in electronics running JavaScript right so we built in an IDE [Music] we come into that down the bottom the game received the technology but if there's and a finger now extend the message receiver [Music] quite an that down for the moment we can play it later though if you want so it's Twilio quest it's one way to use egg rock without even knowing you're using rank rock which is cool so we were not happy with writing text writing code in the text area not happening on the developer Evangeline team but myself and colleague Dominic who's based in San Francisco both sort of came up with different tools and different ideas that we wanted to build grew into what it was a service tool kit for Tullio stuff so Dominic built Twilio Run which was a local kind of mimic environment of of the Troyer functions platform and then I was like that's cool how do we start brought those products easily I created create Tulio function which is a nice little project which just spins up a scaffolded thing and then together we kind of came up with some function templates a lot like the samples that you just saw in the strengths version and those function templates can then connect up with will you run and create really a function to to build new things so I'm going to show that quickly what do we got so I'm just gonna because I called it create really a function you get to then do NPM init toyou function which I think it's cool and let's call it hello strength and I'm actually gonna use template and the template is gonna be it's gonna in this case I can tell you that so MPA a minute is great because you don't have to download and install create relay function in the first place this may take its time because internet and NPM install but doesn't matter no I'm gonna keep talking what does that because it's going to ask me something in a minute and so this little tool yeah is creating a local environment for you to build and Tullio functions with and then run them and then here it is gonna ask me in a minute you hate it when it goes quiet like that flash flash you're supposed to be doing stuff nvm oh I'm supposed to not kick the I have kicked the video cable and possibly it would be a description if that had finished in the meantime we can also list the templates which is nice I can't remember the year there mean one but then let's go see what they're supposed to be called I just want to make sure I did spell it right you know right who knows I never know how to use flags and they should both work let's leave that doing that for a second I'll come back to in a minute that's the demo this was the unofficial logo of the service toolkit because the team building the the severest platforms weren't building these tools and every time we told them about a new thing the project manager the product manager said he was happy as a CEO with a french fry and so if you've been to the beach recently you know what that's like work you bastard all right we'll come back to in a minute and then eventually we built CLI as well this year which was announced and released in August I don't actually know what the driving thing for the CLI was initially it wasn't I don't think it was actually webhooks we just wanted to be able to do everything on the API via a CLI by the command-line interface so you can do things like using the core API and list out your messages we can currently list our debug logs we're working on streaming them that will be nice in the future but one of the fancy little things we did include in it was a way to tunnel to your phone number and so I'm going to come back to that ins yes so this is nice it's asking me about my account credentials and now it's totally do the templates and now it's installing other things around the end so we'll come back to that in a minute because I have the Twilio CLI over here and so there's a bunch of stuff has also complete that's important because when you go down the API core and then order completing that kind of stuff is useful but I'm going to do that right now I'm going to use the phone numbers section gin and I gotta update our phone number so that was the phone number that we got earlier which is not never gonna let's get back to you here and get my phone number and you know update it I'm gonna set the voice URL - you know said it's a local host and this is the fancy thing it will be running a Lagos 3,000 never if we do that well it's gonna do actually detected we're trying to set the local host spin up and rock in the background and give us an Iraqi URL that is now pointing around so that's there this now works so if I had CD into hell that's better CD into hello strap and run NPM start that's going to start up Tulio Run which is then created this function in point so this n grok URL is now pointing at that and so if I copy that oops let's just grab that not load it grab it I can go back over here and what I can actually do is just kind of let messages and go get those messages that we send earlier using that client quiet messages list gonna list the messages that were to that number not that messages you having to copy the number messages that were to the number we bought earlier once we've got those out set messages to them that's nice easy one that shouldn't take us too long probably alright we had 22 messages that's nice that's pretty cool so using those messages I can now kind of run through them and what we can console.log everybody's favorite emoji that's the body of the message you were good right I trust you for now and then we can create calls back calls that create I'm going to create that call from as I said the number we bought earlier to end up from which is the number you've sent the message from and then a URL which is which we know the URL is this one which is created by the CLI for us and then if we just close that loop that's gonna run through all these messages it's going to show us all these emojis but it's also going to start this close calls which are going to run against the thing running on my laptop right now so cool dropped a memesters nice and you should find your phone start to ring in a second I've got mine yeah nice tell you so you knew what was coming I guess it's kind of telegraphed in the whole thing but as we can see those post requests are all coming in from the from the web hooks that being sent from the API to get that synchronous API response back to us and it was all because we just updated the phone number to a local host URL that should keep going for a little while cool so the CI allows you to do that which is quite cool and then even better I thought was doing it I like that we actually built the CLI not in go which I thought would have been a nice idea because of that ability to build releases for all platforms we actually chose Heroku so cliff node.js library which has allowed us still to produce C lies for debian-based Linux right now I don't think we've got other ones and Windows a Mac you can install via NPM or brew or I think we might have done a Windows thing that I don't use Windows so I can't remember it but it also meant that people could in there anybody in the company didn't have to learn go it's not a language use that much at all you so you can build our CI plugins or indeed features into the CLI using JavaScript which we like and you can build your own and so that service toolkit I talked about before which was made up of three in fact to another service API plot module as well has now been built up into a server let's plug in and actually you can see that and stop it truly help we've got a service one down the bottom also token as a plug-in as well which does things with them JD be teased that we need for Tory so the CLI then allows us to expand this with user contributions as well and so that was the trouble with notebooks I find it's really hard for people to get started with web hooks if they'd not use them before and it's a pain if you have no one was pleased with it when when Thor asked earlier and so we've attacked this on multiple fronts as you can see simple applications using this to emulate sort well winds as part of education we try and bring people onto and rock with truly o quests but also kind of hide and rock away inside to leo quest as well non developers can use non developers and developers can use studio to build stuff and then for an actual developer environment the service toolkit and the trolley or CLI allows to build and automate things and the service platform actually has an epi now so you can develop on your laptop using servers toolkit to deploy apps to production to test locally deploy to production and be happy so that's all the stuff we've done with web hooks it's willingham I've had a breath if you are interested in this go play Julia quests will come slash quest it's a lot of fun for a documentation platform and if you are interested in any of those open-source projects things around the toy your service toolkit then gone slash Twilio Labs is where we're doing that the sea lion itself actually lives at to github.com slash Twilio slash truly ocmi but it's also part maintained by a robot because we're not writing all those api's there's hundreds of them and that's all I've got for you thank you so much for joining us in this evening my name is Arash I work at rollio thank you [Applause] [Music]\", metadata={'source': '3_zjCbfJG3c', 'title': '\"The trouble with

'Stripe Developers'}), Document(page_content=\"[Music] awesome sorry about that everyone I think that's working there we go so I'm here I'm from Trekkie go talk about providing a native experience for third party apps so this is kind of a new type of talk for me it's the first time in I guess my history where I've actually done to talk about a project that I didn't physically actually build with my own two hands like it's part of being a CTO of a larger company is that a real company is that now actually people do like I get to take advantage take responsibility for other people's work so just first before I get I just want to say thanks like obviously this is a team effort all of these things are so just in case that doesn't come across I wanna make sure that's there so where are we this is me I'm the founder and CTO of tradegecko I've been moved here eight years ago with my brother to start the company I was told to put something funny about myself so what I did end up with is this little video which is I'm sorry it's about a 30 seconds long but it's pretty awesome and it's nonno unable to play take two yep not gonna work well that was a cool idea anyway so this is a video of me and galapagos early this year this thing is the size of a school bus whale shots pretty amazing so yeah that's my life outside of tick and then try eco so for those of you who don't know who we are we're building the calmest operating system big part of what we do is inventory in order management so our customers are brands mostly brands and and they're wholesalers and we help them run their the back end of the business from sales or during purchasing stock management all those lovely little things right up until we plugging into e-commerce platforms and people like stripe here's a cool little gif so this is us in the middle and this does make a little like it is kind of relevant to my story so I thought in there it's not just trying to sell the dream but you can see we're in the middle of plugging into a bunch of different pieces so Trey you go a big part of what we do is the integration piece and so that's why it's quite exciting to come here and talk about what we're doing to above and beyond the usual exposing your API Docs to try and help integrate pieces tighter into the into our system and solving real customers problems so I want to talk about once kind of really talk about one specific thing here and so to talk about sales channels and so a big part of what the problems we solve in customer belly we provide is allowing our customers to sell on multiple sales channels so they might have a Shopify store also on Amazon they're selling HC they'll sell eBay PrestaShop Walmart Magento and all sorts of different things and so the we have iconic in Australia open working with lazada so all over the world is everywhere has kind of different localized sales channels and you breaking it into the e-commerce in the end of the marketplaces um okay go back for this one when it comes to sales funnel you're passing a lot of data back and forth telling them the products they need to sell the pricing you need to sell them at how much stock they have and when they do so we bring the sales orders back in we'll manage them in fulfillment goes backwards and forwards payment details go backwards and forwards and so back in 2013 just as we were getting started we had I guess it actually was only a two-person engineering team and we built out the basics of our back-end and the first thing we look first integration we're looking at um was okay we've got a lot of customers is these are these small small businesses are small SMB businesses this kind of cool little brands and at that time and to be honest even now back then Shopify was a scrappy little e-commerce player these days obviously they took over the world so it's been exciting to watch them grow but back then they'll even then it made a lot of sense so the first thing we did is we built out integration in to Shopify and so we build that smack-bang right into the middle of our code base it was a core part of what we were doing were we kind of tied ourselves to the wagon to chop Affairs that were growing and that was pretty solid so we kind of took a couple of couple of Engineers to go with that one I'm gonna get is this why people don't use Google slides okay do I manually I lost one of the images okay anyway and so as we kind of the months and years we wanted on we realized okay Shopify is a great one but a lot of our customers actually have these multiple channels and so pretty quickly we built out some other integrations again tightly tied into what we were building the blank one is actually supposed to be a WooCommerce logo about six to eight months later was Magento logo then went to Amazon and obviously was taking us at will just realizing as we were growing the complexity of these pieces and just looking after them the engineer growth went pretty crazy with it we loading basically two engineers per integration and so one thing we took us a few years and I think most of the seniors any senior developers one of the things you realize over time is that the building of something is usually the the tiniest part of the cost it's the maintain maintenance over time and again this is another one I feel like I've kind of Ty Lee tied to the stripes stripe what do you mean call yourself is stripes the stripes in the room where the second you're talking to third parties that maintenance cost skyrockets and so if you have to come to different moving parts everything that all becomes a lot harder so we built a big commerce integration and today we're at 12 sells engine it sales channels however we aren't at whatever is about 48 engineers and my little thing that we're we're not putting 40 engineers to manage our sales channels and and we kind of realized after about four or five that we needed to start looking it another way of doing it so where do we go from there as we continue to scale that what our options kind of looking at three main options just keep hiring you just just you've got your your oh in problem here just every new integration you need an extra X number of engineers probably more of an imp one then o in but um option number one reasonably common this whole business is built around it number two is to go back to the drawing board react attack to see what you can do to extract the parts they're different and really keep your primary flows as straight as possible and number three is to outsource so these are the obviously the three clear options we ended up going with option 4 which was kind of it was taken out of our hands a little bit we had our sales team in Toronto so we have secondary office in Toronto they work with the partnership and started it was one calmer situation that they built custom for a customer and they kind of threw it over the throw it over the fence and then a couple more and before we knew we had half a dozen integrations that were built by a third-party integrator that we hadn't really been a part of in of the build or approval and but we had a lot of customers is simple significant number of customers using them and with suddenly our problem not great obviously is communication problems but we're like okay so what are options now and so how do we get here so I'll trade you your platform as it is we provide a lot of a lot of okay so few suite of apps to work with but little about our entire platform is built on the idea that everything is API driven as well so all of our apps are actually built on top of our own internal API I'm so everything we've built is available so all the power of our platform is available to third parties to build upon in our API is reasonably comprehensive it's reasonably well document reasonably well documented it's not amazingly comprehensive and it's not amazingly well documented but we're kind of halfway there but what we realized pretty quickly was that these sales channels were actually a huge portion of the things they were people wanting to plug into this and plug into their systems and when they were there also the most important thing for them to give a price to get exactly right so what I realized is that actually when it comes to building out your API is building out clear well-documented clean restful api is one thing but actually sometimes you really need to make sure you're optimizing for the actual workflows that are coming through listen up so we're actually up to 63 integrations and Counting of which I just a big thanks that they're gonna cover a few awesome one of our designers Shep he's basically responsible to every single awkward gif throughout the presentation so we got sorry 63 integrations and that soon I think we're at 15 sales channels but as I just kind of mentioned did the other 45 50 things actually going along really well they go rebuilt some internally some externally some by third-party somebody themselves um but again we come back to the point we real Kate keep coming back to the point their sales channels your your e-commerce platforms your marketplaces with something special um and that's because they touched money at the end of the day the custody can mess up some of the things a little bit if they claim so that but the second you start losing sales for them for your customers they get angry very quickly and so big things for us particularly around the stock manage one is around over selling and understand if you're if you have to channel sales channels one of them runs out of a product and the customers running their entire business of a single stock location you need to make sure that those those API calls are going back with an forces and forth as fast as possible there's realistically there's not that much you can do about over something completely but what our job is to minimize it as much as possible is that I don't sell the same product on two channels at the same time so that was an interesting one the the outcome of that one is actually you get you have to jump on and make a and the customers have to go jump on I have a nice apology conversation with their customer which obviously not something I want to do but the other side is obviously under selling if we get the stock levels wrong on the downside they may have a mess of sell and not actually get them at the door basically that's the bottom line really frustrates people and the last one put up there which is something it took us a few years to realize and I think again it's I've read it's read a few documents about it strike from short panel at some time the big one every doubt was it's so Shopify they're about ten years old maybe no actually 15 years old now it took them three or four years to really take the system to handle the big guys on the flash sales if someone is the your big your your Kardashians and so forth I selling a thousand things in a minute your system has to handle a very different kind of load then your usual one don't know how many times this slides in here okay cool I mean there's couple more things we've taken on the ownership of being the source of truth for a business so that's both exciting for us as a business was also really scary and it involves a lots of responsibility and we're in this place now where anything kind of goes wrong anywhere is always our fault no matter what's going on at being that central source of truth yes you've got the power and the ability and you can really help the customers grow and so so their needs but again you're responsible if literally anything that's wrong by being in the middle and so when it comes to sales channels again you're dealing with your product details pricing catalogs imagery sales payments shipping details there's a lot of pieces to a lot of moving pieces okay so I think I've spent much too much time talking about why specifically this is the problem we needed to tackle I'll now kind of jump into where we went with it so there's this massive Dewalt that was there was this massive divide and we had built out six five integrations internally and then we had about another half a dozen that have been built internally and so the difference was you came into a if it was one that we built we'd really optimize the UI works really well he was very clear we explained exactly what he did happen to each stage there wasn't any going backwards and forwards and unnecessary handshakes and so we wanted to make sure as we were tackling this problem to write that one of the big things the number one thing we wanted to improve was making sure that setup flow was as smooth as possible and we're seeing massive drop-offs on these things so these are some pretty content driven customers and there was still drop-off in the process of sending up their channels so we drove and we did a bunch of UX research we talked to customers we're understanding what that was and so those that those answers we've kind of driven through to drive and develop our internally built intuitions and we're trying to work out how can we use that information to help our part out third parties build the same sort of quality integration on top of us there's a few more things going down there as we've a lot of the third parties based on how usually with an API integration you're plugging something in and but if you have one if you have a trade a single trade you account you have two or three of your PrestaShop each of those process job is going to be coming in through the same IPM through the same third party built integration but we still wanted to be able to make sure we stood out that data when it got into your your core system same with the settings same idea settings reporting and the big one for us is the debug ability at the end of the day with if you've got two systems talking things are going to break there's literally nothing you can do about it the internet might go down HTTP issues AWS has gone down more than it's about once a year it's not very often but the entire internet crashes so these things you can't possibly assume that this is absolutely not going any bugs so we need to provide the ability to debug both internally and to give a bit of that power to our customers so the way that okay the way that was working as you kind of needed to jump between tricky go your third party I think we go moving with lazada with these for this story trejo Lozada and also the third party built in the middle some of the settings as you're going along were sitting up which top location you wanted which stop location you were storing your stocking and so you had the stock they were specific to that warehouse was really important depending on whether you wanted to make sure you had that set up before you started thinking your products otherwise you be sitting in the wrong stock levels another big one was actually for the same sort of thing the to be able to do that you'd also need to have access to that list of locations you're looking for before you'd install the integration and then the last one is just making it easier for developers to test and go live build the quality first step up was just kind of rolling a back-end this is this is our oil flow nothing too fancy we kind of built it before but making sure we had all their visibility in there as much as possible and so the first thing we kind of worked on was this and so I think we talked about it yeah where we landed was building out basically as a DSL driven ice UI framework I wish I wish I had a better term we've been calling it our SDK um but they write I think actually it goes down it's about a 300 line json schema and we use that to build up the entire process so this page here is completely driven by this okay so you can see here we asked for two things one we need some ways to get your settings at your logs and then down here we see this is an install schema here so each one of these sort of fields with with fiction's maps to us a page here so we turn to that JSON blob and we build out this four four page field and with this we kind of build out the 4-piece said that they could really customize what they need and so so we've got different types as well so we've got our basic type which is basic string we have Association selects basic simple selects and building all these things we could build out build out this comprehensive onboarding flow for our customers that are for our developers for our customers to use to check boxes again so that it's quite a suddenly this this entire page was ok I'm hoping I am sharing my excitement I'm not sure if you guys are quite as excited as Mel but this was such an interesting and very just very obvious problem to our customers it was really nice to be able to solve it in such a flexible way ok so the first step we would pull in was actually provide bit providing ability to build out this entire flow by JSON so you can big piece were aiming so obviously installation flow was around the branding okay that was the whole thing sorry I just totally on top of this there we go so we're breaking down kind of our major problems that we'd identified number three ones we're really about managing hey what if I have multiple stores how can I separate that data route so from a back-end point of view what we ended up reasonabie so what we just ended up building a joint able to allow specific integrations once we kind of turned that function early on to set up what was the equivalent of the same internally we have what we call an integration model and that is plugging in through your standard OAuth integrations and then we have what call we would call the channel and that was mapping to our internal ones so exposing the API we provided a lot of functionality around again we've got here so this is this is our b2b platform Shopify stores or Buhl's internally and we managed it was just very exciting the day we could start seeing that our customers who put their their custom integrations right into the dashboard with all the reporting with no extra work and so ok debugging sync actions either said before a really important part of us all being able to track what's going on and and act on those and so we ended up building up a couple of things as well so part of the same sort of schema we asked them to provide us URLs so every time in our app in our app for our entirely build ones we have an arrow log you can go through you can see which of your sinks have worked which ones have failed successful and all your failures will have an action attach them do you want to retry it you want to throw it away I would try to make those context-dependent and we've exposed that we've asked for that from the same customers from our third-party developers so we asked him to expose a simple API for us to post out throw the data they throw it back we asked for three URLs they finis Becker specifically formatted JSON which turned out pretty nice and we can render an entire page good actions there okay I'm going through this faster than I thought that's fine okay and then I think the piece that as engineers you kind of don't take into account quite as much but actually at the end of the day is probably the most important part is the people so I spent a lot of time doing training between our partners in ourselves I think the most important the most apart from the technology the most available thing we have is actually slack releasing their shared channels it's been amazing for us just throwing the conversation backwards and forth and really spinning some serious serious time on the API documents will build a custom one we roll it out super clear and it's actually we're on to a third or fourth integration now sort of integrator now with very little polish to go now yeah good old shared slack channels I think I'm hoping I blowed out everything important yeah there you go so this is this is just a matter of one of our team I blew out her name and then just left it there anyway and one of our team throwing mister straight out to the moon coming back anyways it's an it's an hour's turnaround time we kind of like there's very few parts here of any business where you can have a third party you're talking to and giving it sort of hours turnaround time so personally I'm actually quite questionable about slack in the workplace as a benefit but this is definitely one of those things where it's provided super value so begin that don't ever underestimate the value of communication and people I think we're to have this as well and there's a bonus we've got some nice tighter integrations so these are our orders we kind of have a nice little link you can really tell well there's a little orange dot on the page probably isn't tell you much but be able to link out straight from the the order page through to the third-party integration so it's nice and tightly tied in so that's kind of where we are today we've been working on this project for let's say three four months actually it's about a six now in about three months to three months of engineering work and then about three months of trying to convince our partners to jump on board it's kind of an ominous with isn't it realistically it's a it's done better than I expected it's not perfect by any faster it's the imagination is to be expected anything bills that you don't build internally that you're relying on things were in backwards affords across the internet it's going to be tricky but really felt out has made a massive improvement however we're not we've still got a long way to go and so we've kind of this this turning point now we're we're kind of questioning what's what's the next step where do we go and so we've I think we've learned a lot probably not quite enough yet because we're looking at two really different directions and we're gonna tackle them at once one is going way back to the start and going wait a sec let's this react I take this as anyone who's both any sort of application for over multiple years will know the rewrite is always so sexy but it's never the right we're very really the right option but sometimes their emotional orientation new system is the most valuable thing you can do and so in the process of trying to understand doing some spikes and what that looks like but in the meantime we are looking at really enhancing what we have even I we feel now at this point what we've built actually could be we should be using reusing and internally so the big pieces were missing now is we we haven't really managed the published unpublished piece so our customers right now they you install your integration and you'll see everything from that store whereas sometimes they won't want all of their products in on all of this stores so giving them ability to see in which products in which direction is really valuable one specific one here is this some high high flow workflows that we treat as a normal API request that we want to optimize and so the big one for us is stock levels soccer balls are changing can be by the minute can be by the even faster than that and that but the changing one hundred to a thousand times as often as anything else is you change your product name your product price a lot less often than you actually sell something so the product that the stock levels changing in a much higher frequency and so we've been looking at actually trying to build it maybe with some pub/sub workflows to actually tighten tie and really tight this so at the end of the day most of those things are working pretty solid through the public API but sometimes those edge cases to really build get to their final level of quality you're gonna have to think outside the box a little bit more Edmond tooling we want to be able to own more than ourselves right it's sort of two kind of big ones though one is we look at what different platforms are looking for in terms of data structures data formats is very different right now we put that responsibility our customers but being able to have the ability for our clients to define via structured schema the specific validations that are required often things like what are your skewed formats it's something we're looking into it said I think it personal another interesting problem to tackle um and then some simple things like right now that JSON blob was invalid if you just throw them we hope to the page saves no one's taken anything down yet but it's a little bit dangerous I put that one or twice all of them in twice okay big pieces other also is how many more places we hope the app the app UI in I think actually might have been Toby from Shopify at sailor a few years ago to kind of feel the same way is that we're in the same sort of space where their job is to lady % of the solutions and provide the API in the App Store for the other 20% and so we're done there by the API calls black exposing the API we've started doing away with some of this to go where you can multi the UI integration um the next one is what how do you put expose more of the state of Iowa Jets and allow the customization that those customers need I guess the the golden rule of sass is you want to make sure you're not doing too much service work you got to find the right balance but also customers always want a little bit more there's always something that you can't provide and to be able to find the best possible experience to them without completely throwing your entire business under the bus providing the ability to have those customizations is super um and the next big one is actually look we've we've got our e-commerce so L becomes kind of SDK and we've got a couple of other um couple of other very common types of integration and just realizing we're all about like it's just a series of acronyms um for those not in the space 3pl is your third-party logistics provider so you put your stock in someone else's warehouse they manage the fulfillment for you and POS point-of-sale so you're looking at your your bins your stripe these are the pieces is we don't really tackle too much around the brick and mortar but there's definitely a space that is adjacent and available oh I talk I've talked about this one first I just really like this gift we actually like a full-on conversation about this today because it's really cool but super unpractical like what happens we're trying to they press on the wrong particularly very specific part of the door you come in there at night I'm like is it it's not as black as it closes it open I think this was like fog design or something to like it was a pretty so yeah that was kind of into what I had today so first look let me introduce you to mocha serious um and thanks for listening open the floor to questions from the floor to questions certainly like I had a couple of my team we're supposed to turn up and like put the exceed them but like things fell apart of the last second now they're just I give it like another 10 seconds of awkwardness before I give up okay thank you all for listening and letting me talk me through this again it's kind of hard sometimes to differentiate the excitement I have for the technology and the problem-solving so I'm hoping I managed to share some of the problem-solving the technology side of things if not so much the interspace room and kind of expected hey if anything sounded interesting we're hiring always and so you know cool thank you [Applause] [Music] you\", metadata={'source': 'ShRb8ItO2r4', 'title': 'TradeGecko: Native-like experience for 3rd party integrations', 'description': 'Unknown',

Document(page_content=\"ramaa hello everyone welcome back to the stripe developer YouTube channel where today we're kicking off a new series about SC a strong customer authentication and specifically how it effects your payment integration in a post SCA world so in this first episode today we want to focus on card on file transactions so transactions where you've previously collected the card details from your customer and then charge them when the customer is not actually on your website or in the app so come SCA these are called off session payments merchant initiated transactions that are out of scope of the strong customer authentication regulation however there are certain nuances in how these cards have to be set up with what we call non payment authentication but also previously stored cards can be used with this MIT framework without having to authenticate this is what we call grandfathering and in general this is what we want to focus on today so my name is Thor I'm an integration engineer and developer advocate at stripe and joining me today is my colleague Mike Mike do you want to quickly introduce yourself yeah thanks I thought so my name is Mike I'm a integration engineer at stripe as well and I've been working with a lot of merchants in terms of their SCA integrations specifically around MIT a lot of people kind of care about charging their cards off session are concerned about when SCA comes in what happens to my cards that I have on file so today we're going to introduce some some tools that we have in beta which will help like just from a developer experience perspective and then we're going to walk through like the API is payment intensive intense grandfathering how it works how to charge cards and also small session and so the first thing that I'm actually going to introduce let me just quickly share my screen is our stripe CLI so today we're going to walk through like a couple of like examples of some requests to the to the API and one of the things that we've launched in beta recently is this stripe CLI so what it is it's a cloud line interface which you can hook up to your stripe accounts your developer stripe accounts and it allows you to send API requests to the strike API without having to like spit on the backend or anything like that and you could of course just run curl but you know there's a lot of syntax around curl and one of the things that the stripe see like gives you which we won't get into today but it's very cool is the ability to listen to web logs so we all used and rock we all forgot that we had our tunnels open for long periods of time and security people probably gave out to us but the stripe CLI now allows you to like listen to advance at - on your stripe account which is very cool you can trigger a web book events so I'd highly recommend having to look at it like I said today we're gonna run all of our examples through the stripe CLI and so to get us kicked off one of the questions we get a lot is like customers why are the customer object different so Ford you want to kind of bring us through the customer object real quick sure yeah I mean in general if you're familiar with stripe and have have built a stripe information before you've probably come across tokens and card IDs and source IDs that you can use with customer objects and specifically for the use case of charging the customer in the future or within a subscription and you know in in the non payment intent world you could say we had the concept of the default source on the customer object so this was a way to charge a customer without specifying which payment method should be charged for this customer and so for example when you previously created a token via stripe J S or the mobile SDKs and then attach that token to a customer it would store a cart ID on the customer object as a default source and so this default source would be charged anytime you would create a charge referencing the this custom ID without providing specifically a payment method that should be charged yeah Mike what we're running into here yeah so I try to put up my custom ID and my stripe CLI is not logged in so I will show you the very cool functionality of the stripe CLI so I just run stripe login it says pairing code is something I hit return which is gonna open a browser I will show you my browser looks like real quick so this is what I see in the browser you can see all I need to do is say allow access I hit allow access I hop back to my terminal and you can see great done the stripe CLI is configured so my previous request which failed because my API key had expired I can run that again to retrieve a customer object that Thor was talking about and you can see great sent a request to the API so as Thor was mentioning the custom object previously had a concept of a default sauce which we can see here which is a cause like a consuls state saved to this customer and yeah as Thor mentioned previously you could pass a customer directly to the charges end point we would infer the default sauce and if you deleted your default source yeah bad things would happen you know even you would have no sauce or it could potentially pick a different source so you have to be more explicit now which is good right yeah yeah I think this was specifically so you we had the concept of the default source but as well as a list of sources I think up to 200 that you could have on on a customer and so what we've seen is that there were integrations out there that would you know kind of charged the wrong source or weren't aware that this specific cart was set as the default source and so going forward we want make really sure that you know you know and tell us very specifically and deliberately what you want to do and achieve and so we have scratched that default source which has some implications for your your integrations but I think Mike do you quickly want to run through kind of what you have to do to transition into this new world yeah so you don't have to do too much right any customer that you have with the default sauce on it currently just on your back-end store the concept of a default yourself you can use the stripe ID to store that on your back-end any net new business that you're kind of adding new cards if you use in the payment methods API you can store that payment method ideas as your kind of your concept of a default in your back-end but strife doesn't really have the concept of a default anymore which will prevent those kind of errors when you're hitting us and say you don't you forget to pass something and we just pick one right so one of the things that we can do now is we can create a and you'll notice the day that I'm passing the color off a lot that's just because I have a white console for readability we do pass back some colors it's hard to read on white so hence that's that's why I think it you might not have to do that yourself so and what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create a payment intent which is our new API for collecting payments and I'm going to create it with my old customer I've got to do nothing with my customer so I'm going to create a payment 210 for an amount of 100 euro I'm going to set the currency here - that's not the currency - euro and I am missing a minus T in front of currency I'm going to immediately confirm this which is going to take the card and it's going to confirm the to confirm the payment intent so that means with payment intents when you confirm it attempts to charge it - checks if it requires authentication or any additional step this card shouldn't so I'm going to say please confirm immediately my customer is gonna be this customer object over here just need to grab if you remember this is specifically the off session use case so you're charging Stuart Scott credentials and when you're doing that you can pass the confirm true flag to create and confirm and therefore attempt to charge those stored credentials within one step and there's one additional flag we have to pass to to say that this is in fact an off session payment right yeah yep which is the one I'm typing in right now so you can see here what I'm going to be doing here is I'm going to send a request to the payments intents API intent is not an API payment too intense is an API so let me just fix that real quick I am passing the customer I'm being explicit about which sauce I want to charge you can see there so I haven't had to cast that to the new API I can use my old ones that are on file and then I'm passing the off session flag of true so hopefully there's no typos there I run that great so I got a response from the API it's looking good I can see there the status is succeeded and I successfully charged this so yeah as you can see in terms of like migrating your your existing cards on file it's very like lift you just have to be explicit about the the default source currently so you could if you don't have it in your back-end currently you could do a retrieve on your customer IDs get the default sauce and pasta three to the payments in cents API and obviously instead of passing the sauce parameter the payments intense API you had passed the the payment method parameter using the new payment methods maybe Mike do you do you quickly want to show that in the API reference yes maintenance backwards-compatible are specifically on that to work with any of your previously stored payment details and so if you look in the API reference we added a very nice search on our hummus recently so plug for the house go check it out and dock motion and yeah a big fan of dock mode as you can see apart from my terminal so as you can see here we have the payment method parameter on the create payments intent but we also have the source parameter which is actually not documented but it is there sorry what specifically you wanted to flag if you go back to the payment methods per um yeah it's as that so you can use any of your payment methods your cards that you previously created from tokens or bank accounts you created from tokens or any safe source objects that are reusable you can feed into the payment method parameter as a value and it will work so that's the nice thing kind of going forward you don't have to worry about your existing stored details they work with payment intents as well cool great and yeah that was those big concern that it's happened to different people it's like what do I do with my with my customer objects so in terms of like previously you would if we have a look very quickly at the create customer and call here actually so which that's funny isn't it didn't have the description and previously you could pass a source right and it would like set it as the default source but of course now with our payment methods API you aren't using sources anymore you might be using payment methods so it's a little different in that previously on the cut on the kind of customers API you would as you can see here pass the sauce to attach to a customer and payment methods are attached to a customer in a very similar way and you can take a customer and a touch a payment method to it however on this API you would look at a customer and see all of its sources so if we go back to if we go back to my terminal you'll see on our customer objects and I'm just gonna clear this real quick and I'm gonna pull up that customer that I pulled up previously right so you can see previously on a customer object and I list the sources here you can see that they're on the customer objects now you don't see a list of payment methods which is a little different people kind of I can look at it and go where where are my payment methods that is actually on the payment methods API you pass a parameter of customers so what we might do you throw real quick is we might add a payment method to our customer show what that looks like yeah and then kind of do a side-by-side so I am very quickly gonna create a customer with like pretty much nothing on it so we are gonna host a payment method to this customer and what this is gonna do is it's gonna create the customer and it's gonna immediately attach a payment method and one thing I am doing here is I am going to bear with me I'm flicking a lot between different shares so I'm gonna pull up a a card from our testing page which is brilliant for SCA we have so many different cards that kind of do different things like they require authentication first and then they fail later so I'm just gonna for a full a fairly peaceful card all kind of default for two for two card here cuz just wants a nice handy card real quick I'm gonna go back to my terminal and I'm gonna stick that in there so this command I run it you can see it succeeded but if I look at my customer object now I don't really see anything on it like it looks like there's no payment methods there you can see the default sources no because we don't saw the concept of a default source anymore but it's kind of like mmm where are my parent methods hmm yeah so what you do now is you actually hit the payment methods API and I can't remember the top my head right now for you know is it opposed to a gift to list all your payment methods for a customer yeah yeah that's a get request ya get requests with the customer as the the parameter we th so I'm just gonna change this front post to it gets its good resource missing no such payment method huh I always I think you're trying to retrieve yeah methods yeah let me see what the list let's let's all see right let's also yet if you go into the API reference reference again so methods even given us working at stripe we don't know it all by heart so here we go list of customers payment methods that's exactly what I want to do and it's a query parameter of customer and the customer type so yeah I haven't tried a query parameter on this before so let's try and see what happens I think you just append it after the URL so you do payment intense question mark so it's guess get query purim oh yeah that should work right yep that should be it I think I missing it's hype card right parameter I missing parameter customer does it default to type cards what's the type let me you type is required does not default so if I possible - deep around which does not work that worked great so now I can see that my customer does in fact have a payment method attached so you can see to the terminal yeah sorry that's fun great so you can see this is the command that I ran so I just pass them as - D customer type card and you can see that now I can see that my customer has this payment method attached which is the four - four - Visa Card so yeah a little different in terms of the api's that you hit - kind of not necessarily create customers but attach payment methods to a customer it's a different parameter on the customer API and then in terms of retrieving payment methods for a customer versus retrieving the sources for a customer also one difference I want to point out payment methods are like an actual object now and there is you know kind of different payment methods out there and some of them might actually require setup or a certain work by you the customer in order to actually make the payment method reusable and we're today we're going to look at that specifically in the context of SE a where post September 14th we actually have to set up a card payment methods to be used in a reusable manner and so that's also a reason why we've shifted to the payment method API in kind of making that a more central piece within the stripe api's yeah so we've kind of covered like creating a payment intent with the customers and your save card details but like what happens if I have a bunch of save card details on file you know SCA comes into effect and you know I've heard talk of grandfather in or do you wanna explain grandfathering to us and and I'll pull up our lovely new Docs which we just shipped urine grandfathering yeah I've just told you earlier the term kind of grandfathering I find it strange maybe as a non-native speaker it sort of in my hand it kind of pops up taking my grandfather on like like a nice you know kind of afternoon out by the seaside or something you know grandfathering but in fact what it means I guess it's a sort of regulatory technical term so specifically grandfathering means any payment details and here card details the newest torch within stripe before the ACA deadline has come and that September 14th we mentioned it a couple times these are exempt from requiring this set up this authentication initially so only when you collect card details post September 14th you actually have to set them up with authentication or what we call non payment authentication for example if you collect the card details without actually making a payment at that point in time but any previously stored context or any card IDs or source IDs that you have on your stripe account before they are grandfathered and can be used for off session payments without requiring authentication and Mike do you want to show us how that works well actually I think you've you've already shown us yeah we yeah we're an hour your honor a request on the stripe CLI so essentially the nuts and bolts of how that works is to be able to claim this grandfathering we have to point to a previous transaction and what we're doing there with the customers and the sources and stuff like that and in the background on the stripe side is that we're looking to see was that tokenized before a CA and if it came into effect and if it was was there a previous transaction and if if there was a previous transaction what we actually do is we pass a reference to that transaction down to the card schemes and that's how like the nuts and bolts or grandfathering works not that you have to worry about it you just pass a customer and a source or a customer and a payment method if you if you tokenized on that API beforehand but obviously there's things like trials where someone can add a con to their account not use it SCA comes into effect their card is still on their account but they haven't used it yet well what can we do for them so so we can actually that's fine as well so what what happens there is we don't have a transaction but we do know that it was tokenized beforehand so strike em can claim grandfathering on your behalf and that's the that's a big piece of minds and I think what I wanted to plug there as well if you are migrating to stripe for example you know now is now is the time there's hasn't been any better time than ever but if you migrate your existing card details say from your own system or you know some other PSP to stripe this grandfathering also works so you don't have to worry about that yeah yeah and pretty much the only thing that you need to do to claim to claim it is like when you're charging your cards off session in a post SCA world you create a payments intent with the off session flag so we we showed you that I'll pull it up again just just to refresh everyone's mind in terms of the the API call so if I just go back through the previous ones that we ran through it was this one here so you can actually see there one second I'll actually clear everything I think if you do command K that's a shortcut for clearing your console no I and then come on see ya you gotta yeah so you can see there that last parameter there the off session true that is essentially grandfathering this transaction because I'm using a customer and a source that is like exists that's an old source and I'm passing it using the payment intents API the off session true that will grandfather this transaction cool now one question that I've gotten a lot from from our users is is this guaranteed to work or could the card issuer request authentication yeah it's nothing is guaranteed right so in a world when post September 14th myself and Thor often joke that it's a bit of an authentication or less you might not need authentication for reasons such as grandfathering or if it's a mail order or telephone order moto transaction or you may get an exemption you make a frictionless because of the many exceptions which have come under SCA so you don't know so you have to be ready and essentially what that means is like handling a authentication required charge so sorry to client code so what that means is we're a bank says I'm not for whatever reason you know i-i've this thing has been grandfathered for too long I don't really maybe they don't support MIT transactions very well although from chatting to lots of banks we've chatted to the largest issuing banks they're all planning on doing this so for whatever reason you could get more authentic ation to client code and what happens when that happens so I'm going to show you mimic an authentication decline code right so my terminal again and we can see that great I use my command k-trick can't see again cool so I have a I'm gonna pull up the payment intense call again and I have a customer who has a card which is from an issuing bank that isn't free very friendly so let me quickly I need to move my recording thinks it's in my way great so I'm gonna grab I think while you do that I can kind of talk in general about what we call these recovery flows so in general if you're charging your customers off session so when they aren't interacting with your website your application it could happen that the off session payment gets stepped up by the card issuer so in that scenario you will get a decline coach that's not something along the lines of authentication required and if that happens you then need some sort of Dunning or Recovery flow to get the customer back on session and do one of two things either get them on session to authenticate this specific payment for their existing payment methods or alternatively collect a new card that hopefully then works with the MIT framework mm-hmm so I'm gonna try and charge this card so there we go as you can see I got an error because I can see a soul subject at the very bottom with an error if I scroll just a little bit up I'll see that my payment intense status is requires payment method which we're going to talk about in just a minute and if I keep scrolling up to find the error I can see that the last payment error on this payment intent hit authentication required decline code which means that this card that I attempted to charge or attempted to grandfather essentially now requires authentication so and one of the reasons that it's now it requires payment method is because if you recall we try to charge this off session right we're just charging it via API so if we put that straight into requires action that means that we have to get the user to action that right but the user may decide to use a different card may not want to use this console hence it goes to requires payment method and we have two possible recovery flows thawed you want to quickly introduce them from here yeah I think I mentioned them already so kind of the the first flow is bring the customer back on session and actually authenticate this payment for the payment method that you have on file so here you could send them an SMS if you have their phone number or you could you know send them an email saying hey your last payment requires authentication and then send them to a page where you can open up you know strike J s the the handle cards payment for this specific payment intent in their existing payment method I think that's scenario one and then the second scenario is or ideally you want you know do that in one page where you allow them to either choose their existing stored methods and perform authentication for that or you allow them to provide using stripe elements for example on your website to provide new card details and store them so yeah exactly so using this payment payment intent if I scroll up I do have a client secret so as Thor mentioned I can pull that into a front-end to capture a new card details fly elements and however I do also have like within my last payment error I have the card that was available so what I'm going to show you now is is taking that source or payment met our payment method works the exact same way that's in the last payment error I can I can essentially update reconfirm this payment intent with with that to use the same one so I just make sure and that's that scenario one where we now actually bring the customer on the session to perform authentication their storage payment details yeah yeah so I need to pause my you have a double-double slash there but I'm gonna put a payment intense ideas very good call yeah because I need to tell the API which payments intense what I am confirming so I scroll up I need to grab my payments intense ID probably the very top oh there we go it's a big object it's a big big object cool so I'm just gonna go back a bit pop it into the confirm so what i'm doing here is my favorite intense is currently at requires payment method so i'm reconfirming it with the sauce from the last payment error this ones do you maybe want to specifically pants off session false or we can just mention that when you don't pass off session true the default value for our session is false so here now by reconfirming and and off session is a confirm time parameter so it isn't stored on the payment intent itself so when you reconfirm the payment intent with the same payment method or a new payment method you now have to say which mode you're in off session true or false and since we omitted it here by default it defaults to false and therefore we're in the on session scenario mmm-hmm yeah and you can see here that my payments intent status has now gone to requires action so this is like the on session type flow as though mentioned so we can use this client secret you can ignore the big certificates they're just because we're using the stripe SDK but we can use the this client secret handler to the stripe JavaScript SDK do the whole handle card have a car payment piece and then this would be authenticated so as for mentioned in this flow you would like send an SMS email push notification whatever it's here to your customer say there was a issue with your payment please hop on to authenticate errs and you can choose to authenticate the payment that failed authentication if you wish and this is how you would do that should we now sort of travel in time a bit into the post SCA world and actually look at setting up a new new card details with what we call non payment authentication or setting up as part of a payment yeah so we have two options for for kind of doing the whole off session flow in SCA world first option is to take a payment immediately so this could be like if you're paying for the first month of a membership and then like you're setting up your card to pay for every subsequent month there's no trial involved there's a payment immediately so the way that you do that is a payment intent followed by payment intents so a payment intent with a parameter called set up future usage off session which takes a payment for the first kind of amount and then it's safe on success of that you can kind of save it to a customer for for use in later and then subsequent payment intents you pass the customer the payment method off session true and you charge it very similarly to how we did the grandfather in case you want to quickly show where that is in the docs yes so I will show you that so there is a pretty good description of this on our Doc's under preparing for SCA which is just under payments it's bit down the bottom and you can see there's a reusing cards section and saving card details is essentially what we're gonna be talking about right now now I'm a big fan of this new second menu on the right hand side that's sort of the table of contents that you can use to between kind of the different cases quite neat this is the first case I talked about which is use the payment intents API take a charge save it for later and there's all the steps that I've described there how do you recommend having a look at it if you have interest to this another option is if you have like a trial or like a metered usage type scenario where you want to save someone's card details and not necessarily charge them right now and then charge them in the future so this could be like ride-sharing something like that saving card details without a payments if the wrong one which is the setup intense API so you do a setup intense API it does what what Phil mentioned called a non payment authentication so it does the 3ds challenge there's no movement the money which is important differentiator between the two different flows and then you attach that payment method to a customer and in the future when you want to charge the person for like a lyft or an uber that they got or like meted usage you can create a payment intent with the customer the payment method and the off session pram so we're gonna quickly try and do two of those one payment payment intent for an amount followed by some off session charges and then as setup intent so in a non payment authentication followed by some charges so we have some reactive elements here which we're gonna mess around with we're gonna ignore the first one the first use case I'm going to go through is creighton up as a payments intents already created when I load this page because though the way payment intents work so there's a payments intense client secret available here so I'm going to take a payment using a card that requires authentication so if you remember we have some great test cards here so while you while you find that test card the demo that we're showing you there is on the reactive stripe elements repository which is open source and maintained by us as well so if you want to take a look at there the react stripe elements in the demo folder there is a whole kind of intense folder that is focusing on payment intents and setup intense how to use the react stripe elements and stripe elements in general to set up your payment methods in a post Sen what yeah yeah big fan of for extra elements yeah so here's a great test card it requires authentication on like one-time payments and it can be saved for off session so I'm going to pop this to here and can I just give it some placeholder values for that and I'm gonna pay so you can see because I'm doing a payment now I get authenticated at get a challenge from 3d secure so we're paying ten dollars and 99 cents I can hit complete authentication and just before I had complete authentication we do get a lot of questions around this iframe questions like can I change the design inside of the iframe what you'll see here in production is actually the bank's page so it's got nothing to do with the merchants and unfortunately you can't can't really changes and all yeah that's a question that we get a lot so I hit complete authentication payments intents is succeeded so I can pop over to my dashboard real quick check out my payments this should load its August everyone's on vacation so so we can see here this payments exceeded if I scroll down to the bottom of its to see where I created it you'll see that the parameters that I created it to be able to do this so you can see here pasta and setup future usage off session this allows this card once it's saved to a customer to be used for off session payments in the future so that's what I'm going to do next is I'm gonna take this card and create a customer for Amish so if I go back one step go back one you know if you look at the confirmation log it should give you here it is oh it's right there really yeah too easy let's try cashbox yeah great so now if I recall I should have an attached call this one no that's not the one there we go so I'm just gonna create a customer give it a payment method so great customer I created so now I have a customer and a payment method so I want to charge this off session so I'll just use the one that I did previously and so it's not a source it is a payment method so I'm gonna get rid of this line also remember you can paste any card source ID into payment method parameter yeah I was passing through sauce there which probably wasn't I wasn't a great demonstration but yeah well we live and learn great so I'm passing a payment intense for a hundred euro which is a little different because the previous one was 1099 so hopefully no one complains but this is a test card so I wouldn't expect so and I'm setting off session to truth so this is an off session payment after setting up the card you can see there the status has succeeded so we're that in a SCA world this is how you would charge cards off session where you're taking a payment up front when you're saving it so you you you take the on session payment for the other kind of like if they're signing up it's a for Jim or something like that and you save the cost the payment method to a customer and then you create a payment method when you're billing kind of cycle ends to you create one offline a payment intent or flight to charge remembering to pass the customer and the payment method and cool so um we're gonna quickly and little short on time we're gonna quickly talk about the handle cloud setup so I'm gonna flick back to there so let me just refresh this page to get a new payment intent to use or set up a tent election creates both so what we're gonna do here is we're going to pretend like we're gonna do a non payment authentication this would be something like signing up for a trial or for like adding a card to your left or uber account something like that so go grab this card again pop that in handle card set up and hit so this is gonna look for a similar it's gonna give me a challenge well that actually reminds me the buttons shouldn't say pay yeah not actually money yeah let's open the pull request okay we should right yeah very importantly syntax does not move money which is nice because you can like do things like synchronously say are completed on your front end and then tell the user yeah that's set up whereas when you're paying on your front end you kinda need to check with your back end to make sure that the payment was received so complete authentication setup intent has succeeded so if I go into my dashboard I won't see that as payments because it's not movement of money as you're a call so what I can do is I can pop into my post and I'll see so here's my setup intents it would Kurt and Marlowe create a call tomorrow because I've now sit so very to customer costing the payment method of the customer loss and now what if I want to do is I want to let's pretend the customers just got a look at I got into a lift and has done a ride so we're gonna pass through the day off session charging for this person so this is passing that payments method and then I'm gonna gonna pass the customer and then let's go and that succeeded so that's a set up in 10 followed by a payment intent and again the usage would be things like metered usage or trial or like a lyft or uber type scenario great Thor anything else we wanted to cover no I think we're pretty much a time we definitely so we're planning on doing this as a series and really are looking to cover certain themes around SCA integrations every every week on our ID and so we'd love to get your feedback you know in the Commons but if you have more questions we've set up a repository it might maybe if you quickly want to navigate there so on the public stripe github account we set up a repository called SCA death chats and there you can ask any kind of integration specific questions that you have by simply opening up an issue with the issue template that we've defined and then what we're going to do is every week we're going to compile these integration questions into themes and then do one of these SCA deaf chats as recalling them so hopefully this was useful for you specifically for cart on file grandfathering and setting up cards in the post SCA walls and hopefully we'll see you next week or the week after or hopefully we won't because you know everything you have to do for your integration but if not you know where to find us thanks everyone for joining us this week and thanks Mike for taking us through all the requests in the stripes Eli yeah thank you very much cool and hopefully see you all soon thanks for joining all right\", metadata={'source': '52oinv6BZ34', 'title':
